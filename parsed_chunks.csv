a63bda96,8,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Overview,"The armed conflict over South Ossetia lasted one week in August 2008 and will have
consequences for lifetimes and beyond. The conflict and its aftermath have seen lives,
livelihoods, homes, and communities devastated in South Ossetia and bordering districts of
Georgia. A significant casualty of the conflict was all sides’ respect for international
humanitarian law.
South Ossetia is a breakaway region of Georgia that shares a border and has very close ties
with Russia. The armed conflict, in the making since spring 2008, started August 7 with
Georgia’s military assault in South Ossetia and Russia’s military response the following day,
and lasted until a ceasefire on August 15, with Georgian forces in retreat and Russian forces
occupying South Ossetia and, temporarily, undisputed parts of Georgia.1 The week of open
conflict, and the many subsequent weeks of rampant violence and insecurity in the affected
districts, took a terrible toll on civilians, killing hundreds, displacing tens of thousands, and
causing extensive damage to civilian property. Today, there is an acute need for
accountability for all perpetrators of violations of human rights and humanitarian law, and
for security conditions to allow all displaced persons to return in safety and dignity to their
homes.
Human Rights Watch carried out a series of research missions in Russia and Georgia,
including in South Ossetia, focusing on violations by all parties to the conflict. We
interviewed more than 460 victims, witnesses, and others, and looked at reporting (and
misreporting) of the conflict in Russia and in Georgia. The international legal framework
within which Human Rights Watch examined the conflict includes international humanitarian
law—chiefly the Geneva Conventions—relating to the conduct of hostilities, humane
treatment, and occupation; and international human rights law, including international law
concerning displaced persons and the right to return.
1
The term ‘undisputed’ is used to refer to any part of Georgia, except South Ossetia and Abkazia, both areas which are
subject to dispute over their sovereignty and have made bids for independence."
7f8c760e,9,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Human Rights Watch found:,"• In a number of instances Georgian forces used indiscriminate and disproportionate
force in artillery assaults on South Ossetia, and in some cases used disproportionate
force in their ground assault. The majority of these instances derived from Georgia’s
use of multiple rocket launching systems, which cannot distinguish between civilian
and military objects, in areas populated by civilians. Many civilians were killed or
wounded.
• In a number of instances in South Ossetia and in undisputed Georgian territory
Russian forces violated international humanitarian law by using aerial, artillery, and
tank fire strikes that were indiscriminate, killing and wounding many civilians.
• Cluster munitions were used by Russian and Georgian forces, causing civilian deaths
and putting more civilians at risk by leaving behind unstable “minefields” of
unexploded bomblets. Their use and impact on civilians in the conflict demonstrates
why in December 2008, 94 governments signed up to a comprehensive treaty to ban
cluster munitions, which had been negotiated just months before the conflict
commenced.
• As an occupying power in Georgia, Russia failed overwhelmingly in its duty under
international humanitarian law to ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety
in areas under its effective control, instead allowing South Ossetian forces, including
volunteer militias, to engage in wanton and widescale pillage and burning of
Georgian homes and to kill, beat, rape, and threaten civilians.
• After Georgian forces withdrew from South Ossetia on August 10, South Ossetian
forces over a period of weeks deliberately and systematically destroyed ethnic
Georgian villages in South Ossetia that had been administered by the Georgian
government. They looted, beat, threatened, and unlawfully detained numerous
ethnic Georgian civilians, and killed several, on the basis of the ethnicity and
imputed political affiliations of the residents of these villages, with the express
purpose of forcing those who remained to leave and ensuring that no former
residents would return. From this, Human Rights Watch has concluded that South
Ossetian forces attempted to ethnically cleanse these villages. Approximately
22,000 villagers, the majority of whom had fled South Ossetia before the conflict
started, remain displaced.
• In committing this violence, South Ossetian forces egregiously violated multiple
obligations under humanitarian law, for which there must be individual criminal
accountability and prosecution for war crimes where appropriate. To the extent that a
number of these prohibited acts were committed as part of a widespread or
3 Human Rights Watch January 2009
systematic attack directed against the civilian population, they may be prosecuted
as crimes against humanity.
• Residents of Akhalgori district—an area in the east of South Ossetia populated
mostly by ethnic Georgians and currently occupied by Russian forces—face threats
and harassment by militias and anxiety about a possible closure of the district’s
administrative border with the rest of Georgia. Both factors have caused great
numbers of people to leave their homes for undisputed Georgian territory.
• During the time when Russian forces occupied Georgian territory south of the South
Ossetian administrative border, Ossetian militias looted, destroyed, and burned
homes on a wide scale, deliberately killed at least nine civilians, and raped at least
two. Russian forces were at times involved in the looting and destruction, either as
passive bystanders, active participants, or by providing militias with transport into
villages.
• Georgian forces beat and ill-treated at least five of the 32 Ossetians detained in"
e6d46cdf,10,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,August in the context of the armed conflict.,"• After the withdrawal of Georgian forces from South Ossetia, South Ossetian forces, at
times together with Russian forces, arbitrarily detained at least 159 ethnic Georgians.
South Ossetian forces killed at least one detainee and subjected nearly all of them to
inhuman and degrading treatment and conditions of detention. They also tortured at
least four Georgian prisoners of war and executed at least three. All of these acts are
war crimes, for which individual criminal accountability must be established.
This report measures each party’s compliance with obligations under international law,
rather than measure it against the conduct of the other party. Exposing violations committed
by one party does not excuse or mitigate violations committed by another party. Which party
started the conflict has no bearing on parties’ obligations to adhere to international
humanitarian and human rights law and to hold violators accountable. Those seeking
answers to questions about who committed worse, or more violations, or who bears
responsibility for starting the conflict, will not find them in this report.
* * *
Human Rights Watch urges the Georgian and Russian governments to investigate and hold
accountable those from their respective forces responsible for international humanitarian
law violations, including war crimes. As it exercises in effective control over South Ossetia,
Russia should investigate and hold accountable South Ossetian forces responsible for war
crimes and other violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Russian
and Georgian governments should provide compensation for civilian damage and"
a0913030,11,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Up in Flames 4,"destruction caused by violations of international humanitarian law for which they are
respectively responsible.
The permanent forced displacement of thousands of people cannot be countenanced. As it
exercises effective control over South Ossetia, Russia has an obligation to provide security
to all persons living there, regardless of ethnicity; this is especially urgent in Akhalgori
district. Ethnic Georgians displaced from South Ossetia should be allowed to voluntarily
return. Russia should publicly promote and implement the right of all persons displaced by
the conflict, without regard to their ethnic background or imputed political affiliations, to
return and live in their homes in South Ossetia in safety and dignity. Russia should prevail
on South Ossetian authorities to publicly acknowledge this and to facilitate returns."
4fb5ee78,11,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Brief Chronology of the Armed Conflict,"After months of escalating tensions between Russia and Georgia and following skirmishes
between Georgian and South Ossetian forces, on August 7, 2008, Georgian forces launched
an artillery assault on Tskhinvali, South Ossetia’s capital, and outlying villages. Assaults by
Georgian ground and air forces followed. Russia’s military response began the next day, with
the declared purpose of protecting Russian peacekeepers stationed in South Ossetia and
residents who had become Russian citizens in recent years. Beginning on August 8, Russian
ground forces from the 58th Army crossed into South Ossetia and Russian artillery and
aircraft hit targets in South Ossetia and undisputed Georgian territory. South Ossetian forces
consisting of several elements—South Ossetian Ministry of Defense and Emergencies, South
Ossetian Ministry of Internal Affairs, South Ossetian Committee for State Security, volunteers,
and Ossetian peacekeeping forces—also participated in the fighting.
Georgian commanders ordered their troops to withdraw from South Ossetia on August 10,
and two days later Russian forces moved into and occupied undisputed Georgian territory
south of the administrative border with South Ossetia, including the city of Gori. In a
separate operation from the west, moving through the breakaway region of Abkhazia (also
supported by Russia), Russian forces also occupied the strategically important cities of Poti,"
09a026ba,11,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,"Zugdidi, and Senaki in western Georgia.","Russia said that its forces completed their withdrawal from undisputed Georgian territory on
October 10, in accordance with an August 15 ceasefire agreement between Russia and
Georgia brokered by the French European Union presidency. The Georgian government
disputes this, pointing to Russian forces’ presence in Perevi, a village on the South Ossetian
administrative border, as well as Akhalgori.
5 Human Rights Watch January 2009"
4f91a1b4,12,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force,"During the shelling of Tskhinvali and neighboring villages and the ground offensive that
followed, Georgian forces frequently failed to abide by the obligation to distinguish between
military targets that can be legitimately attacked, and civilians, who may not be targeted for
attack. This was compounded by Georgia’s failure to take all feasible measures to avoid or
minimize civilian casualties. While Human Rights Watch found no evidence that Georgian
forces sought to deliberately target civilians, from our research Human Rights Watch
concluded that Georgian forces demonstrated disregard for the protection of civilians during
the shelling campaign, resulting in large-scale damage to civilian objects and property, and
civilian casualties.
The sole fact of civilian casualties or destruction of civilian objects is not an indication that a
violation of international humanitarian law occurred. What is important to seek to determine
is whether there was evidence of a legitimate military target in the attack area at the time,
and how that target was attacked. Circumstances did not always allow such a determination.
Yet many of the attacks on South Ossetia during the brief conflict can be clearly attributed to
Georgian forces—based on witness accounts, the direction of the attack, and the timing of
the damage in light of the advance of Georgian forces.
In many cases Human Rights Watch researchers found no evidence of military objectives in
the area under attack, while in many others we found that Georgian attacks struck legitimate
military targets, causing combatant and, in some cases, collateral civilian casualties. In
some cases we investigated, evidence suggests that the Georgian attacks against lawful
military objectives may have been disproportionate, as the expected loss of civilian life or
destruction of civilian property would have have expected to exceed any anticipated military
gain.
The massive shelling of Tskhinvali and neighboring villages by Georgian forces was
indiscriminate because, at the very least, the Georgian military effectively treated a number
of clearly separated and distinct military objectives as a single military objective in an area
that contained a concentration of civilians and civilian objects. In a number of artillery
attacks Georgian forces failed to take all feasible precautions to minimize loss of life or
injury to civilians.
Georgia’s use of multiple rocket launching systems, such as BM-21s (“Grads”) in civilian
populated areas violated international humanitarian law’s principle of distinction. These"
4a486943,13,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Up in Flames 6,"weapons cannot be targeted with sufficient precision to be accurate against military targets,
and their broad area effect makes their use incompatible with the laws of war in areas where
civilians or civilian objects (such as schools or hospitals) are located. The use of such
weapons in populated areas is indiscriminate by nature and thus prohibited under
international humanitarian law.
Georgian forces attacked vehicles in which many Ossetian civilians were trying to flee the
conflict zone on August 8–10, which resulted in death and injuries. The cases Human Rights
Watch describes in this report indicate that—in those cases at least—disproportionate force
was used and precautions were not taken to avoid or minimize loss of civilian life."
dd03b92a,13,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Conduct of ground troops,"During Georgian forces’ ground offensive there were also attacks which, Human Rights
Watch’s investigation suggests, failed to respect the principle of proportionality: attacks
such as when Georgian tanks targeted buildings in which Ossetian fighters may at times
have been present, but where there were also many civilians sheltering in the basement.
Several Ossetian civilians reported looting by Georgian ground forces but otherwise
generally did not report other specific incidents of abusive treatment during the ground
offensive by Georgian troops. Those detained by Georgian forces, however, reported they
were ill-treated when taken into custody."
b0ec948e,13,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force,"Russian forces attacked areas in undisputed Georgian territory and in South Ossetia with
aerial, artillery, and tank fire strikes, some of which were indiscriminate, killing and injuring
civilians. With regard to many aerial and artillery attacks Russian forces failed to observe
their obligations to do everything feasible to verify that the objects to be attacked were
military objectives (and not civilians or civilian objects) and to take all feasible precautions
to minimize harm to civilians. In one case, Russian forces attacked medical personnel, a
grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime.
As noted above, the mere fact of civilian casualties or destruction of civilian objects does not
mean that a humanitarian law violation occurred. In each attack examined, Human Rights
Watch sought to determine whether there was evidence of a legitimate military target in the
attack area, and if so how that target was attacked.
7 Human Rights Watch January 2009
Between August 8 and 12, Russian forces attacked Georgian military targets in Gori city and
in ethnic Georgian villages in both South Ossetia and undisputed Georgian territory, often
causing civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects such as houses or apartment
blocks. The proximity of these military targets to civilian objects varied. In several cases, the
military targets were within meters of civilians and civilian homes, and the attacks against
them resulted in significant civilian casualties.
In other cases the apparent military targets were located as far as a kilometer away from
civilian objects, and yet civilian casualties also resulted. In attacking any of these targets the
Russian forces had an obligation to strictly observe the principle of proportionality, and to
do everything feasible to assess whether the expected civilian damage from the attack
would likely be excessive in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated. In many
cases the attacks appear to have violated this proportionality principle. In yet other cases,
Human Rights Watch investigated—but was not able to identify—any legitimate military
targets in the immediate vicinity at the time of the attacks. The absence of a military target in
the vicinity of an attack raises the possibility that Russian forces either failed in their
obligation to do everything feasible to verify that the targets were military and not civilian,
that they were reckless toward the presence of civilians in their target zone, or that Russian
forces deliberately targeted civilian objects.
In several incidents involving military force against civilian vehicles, Russian forces may
have intentionally targeted civilians. Deliberate attacks on civilians amount to war crimes."
53377eef,14,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Conduct of ground troops,"Several local residents told Human Rights Watch that many of the Russian servicemen who
occupied undisputed Georgian territories behaved in a disciplined manner and in some
cases even protected the civilian population from Ossetian forces, militia members, or
looters. Nevertheless Russian forces played a role in the widespread looting of Georgian
homes by Ossetian forces. Russian forces facilitated and participated in these war crimes,
albeit in less prominent roles than South Ossetian forces, but we identified four cases in
which Russian forces played an active and discernable role in looting.
Human Rights Watch also documented incidents in which Russian tanks fired at close range
into civilian homes."
fb39b543,15,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Russia’s responsibility as occupying power,"When Russian forces entered Georgia, including South Ossetia, which is de jure part of
Georgia, they did so without the consent or agreement of Georgia. International
humanitarian law on occupation therefore applied to Russia as it gained effective control
over areas of Georgian territory. Russia failed overwhelmingly in its duty as an occupying
power to ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety in areas under its effective
control in South Ossetia. This allowed South Ossetian forces to engage in wanton and
widescale pillage and burning of Georgian homes and to kill, beat, rape, and threaten
civilians. Roadblocks set up by Russian forces on August 13 effectively stopped the looting
and torching campaign by Ossetian forces, but the roadblocks were inexplicably removed
after just a week."
f9babba4,15,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,In South Ossetia,"Beginning just after the withdrawal of Georgian troops from South Ossetia, South Ossetian
forces, including volunteer militias, embarked on a campaign of deliberate and systematic
destruction of the Georgian government-administered villages in South Ossetia. This
involved the widespread and systematic pillage and torching of houses, and beatings and
threats against civilians. Starting August 10, after Russian ground forces had begun to fully
occupy South Ossetia and were moving onward into undisputed Georgian territory, Ossetian
forces followed closely behind them and entered the ethnic Georgian villages.
Upon entering these villages, Ossetian forces immediately began going into houses,
searching for Georgian military personnel, looting property, and burning homes. They also
physically attacked many of the remaining residents of these villages, and detained dozens
of them. Human Rights Watch received uncorroborated reports of at least two extrajudicial
killings of ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia that took place amidst the pillage. In most
cases, Russian forces had moved through this set of Georgian villages by the time South
Ossetian forces arrived. In other cases, Russian forces appeared to give cover to South
Ossetian forces while they were committing these offenses.
By August 11 the attacks intensified and became widespread. Looting and torching of most
of these villages continued intermittently through September, and in some through October
and November.
Ossetian forces rounded up at least 159 ethnic Georgians (some of whom were abducted
from undisputed Georgian territory), killing at least one and subjecting nearly all of them to
9 Human Rights Watch January 2009
inhuman and degrading treatment and conditions of detention. They also tortured at least
four Georgian prisoners of war and executed at least three.
Human Rights Watch’s observations on the ground and dozens of interviews conducted led
us to conclude that the South Ossetian forces sought to ethnically cleanse this set of
Georgian villages: that is, the destruction of the homes in these villages was deliberate,
systematic, and carried out on the basis of the ethnic and imputed political affiliations of the
residents of these villages, with the express purpose of forcing those who remained to leave
and ensuring that no former residents would return."
d2694dd9,16,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,In undisputed Georgian territory,"Beginning with the Russian occupation of Georgia and through the end of September,
Ossetian forces, often in the presence of Russian forces, conducted a campaign of
deliberate violence against civilians, burning and looting their homes on a wide scale, and
committing execution-style killings, rape, abductions, and countless beatings."
f4c1e244,16,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Crimes against humanity,"In both locations South Ossetian forces, including volunteer militias, egregiously violated
multiple obligations under humanitarian law. Murder, rape, acts of torture, inhuman or
degrading treatment, and wanton destruction of homes and property are all strictly
prohibited under both humanitarian law and serious violations of human rights law, and the
perpetrators of such acts should be held criminally responsible for them. To the extent that
any of these prohibited acts was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack
directed against any civilian population, they may be prosecuted as a crime against
humanity. Where any of these acts, as well as acts such as imprisonment, unlawful
detention of civilians, pillaging and comprehensive destruction of homes and property, were
carried out with discriminatory intent against a particular group, in this case ethnic
Georgians, they also constitute the crime of persecution, a crime against humanity,
prosecutable under the statute of the International Criminal Court."
8a3736e8,16,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Use of Cluster Munitions,"During the armed conflict both Georgian and Russian forces used cluster munitions, which
are munitions that release dozens or hundreds of bomblets, or submunitions, and spread
them over a large area. Because cluster munitions cannot be directed at specific fighters or
weapons, civilian casualties are virtually guaranteed if cluster munitions are used in
populated areas. For this reason, using cluster munitions in populated areas should be"
c1312a1d,17,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Up in Flames 10,"presumed to be indiscriminate attack, which is a violation of international humanitarian law.
Cluster munitions also threaten civilians after conflict: Because many submunitions fail to
explode on impact as designed, a cluster munitions strike often leaves a high number of
hazardous unexploded submunitions—known as duds—that can easily be set off upon
contact.
Human Rights Watch was not able to conduct adequate research to establish whether
Georgia’s use of cluster munitions was indiscriminate. Due to either malfunction or human
error, Georgian cluster munitions landed in undisputed Georgian territory on days prior to
the arrival of Russian forces there, killing at least one civilian and wounding two others. The
report documents how at least three people were killed and six wounded by cluster duds
that exploded upon contact in three villages in undisputed Georgian territory.
Georgia has acknowledged its use of clusters, and conducted a campaign following the
armed conflict to warn civilians of the dangers posed by unexploded submunitions.
Russia has not acknowledged its own use of cluster munitions. Russian forces used cluster
munitions in strikes against targets in populated areas in the Gori and Kareli districts just
south of the South Ossetian administrative border, killing at least 12 civilians and injuring at
least 46 at the time of attack. All of these strikes amounted to indiscriminate attacks.
The Russian and Georgian governments should join the 95 nations that have signed the
Convention on Cluster Munitions, which imposes a comprehensive ban on the use of these
weapons. Russia should make every effort to assist demining organizations with clearance
and risk education in contaminated areas currently under effective Russian control, and
Georgia should expand its cooperation with these organizations."

operation in Europe (OSCE), and the Council of Europe have put in place mechanisms to
monitor the human rights situation and promote security and stability near and in South
Ossetia. Russia and Georgia should fully cooperate with these initiatives. The Russian
government in particular should provide full, unimpeded access to South Ossetia to these
intergovernmental organizations so that they may fully implement these initiatives.
At the end of 2008 Russia refused to approve budgetary support for the OSCE’s presence in
Georgia, claiming that the organization had to separate its work on Georgia’s two breakaway
regions—Abkhazia and South Ossetia—from work on other parts of Georgia. At this writing

f949e41a,19,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in the Conflict,,Methodology,"A team of Human Rights Watch researchers conducted a number of research missions from
August to November 2008 in South Ossetia and in undisputed parts of Georgia, and in
August in North Ossetia (in the Russian Federation), to document violations of international
humanitarian law and human rights law committed by all sides in the conflict.
Human Rights Watch researchers conducted three approximately one-week missions in
South Ossetia beginning on August 10, and again in September and November. One of these
missions was carried out jointly with Human Rights Centre Memorial, a Russian
nongovernmental human rights organization.
Human Rights Watch researchers conducted research in undisputed parts of Georgia
continuously from August 11 to 28, and again for one week in mid-September and one week
in mid-October. Extensive research was conducted in the Gori and Kareli districts of
undisputed Georgian territory while those districts were under Russian occupation. Human
Rights Watch experts on armaments, including cluster munitions, participated in research
missions in August and October. Human Rights Watch’s Tbilisi-based researcher conducted
follow up research after fact-finding missions.
Human Rights Watch researchers conducted over 460 in-depth interviews with victims and
witnesses of abuses committed by all parties to the conflict. Interviewees included persons
residing in towns and villages of South Ossetia and undisputed Georgian territory; persons
displaced from South Ossetia and undisputed parts of Georgia living in displaced person
shelters in various parts of Georgia; persons displaced from the conflict and temporarily
staying in North Ossetia; persons formerly detained by Russian and Ossetian forces; persons
formerly detained by Georgian forces; former prisoners of war detained by Georgian forces;
former prisoners of war detained by Russian and Ossetian forces; Georgian soldiers
participating in active combat in South Ossetia; and members of South Ossetian militia and
other forces.
In the course of their research, Human Rights Watch staff visited the following places in
South Ossetia: Tskhinvali, Khetagurovo, Dmenisi, Sarabuki, Gromi, Tbeti, Novyi Tbet,

Interviews with victims and witnesses in South Ossetia were conducted in Russian by native
Russian speakers. Interviews in Georgia with victims and witnesses were in some cases
conducted in Russian by native or fluent Russian speakers; in some cases in Georgian by a
native Georgian speaker; and in other cases in Georgian with the assistance of an interpreter
translating from Georgian to English. The majority of interviews were conducted in private; a
small proportion were conducted in groups. Before being interviewed, interviewees were told
of the purpose of the interview, informed what kinds of issues would be covered, and asked
whether they wanted to proceed. No incentives were offered or provided to persons
interviewed. (More detail on the methodology used for particular aspects of the research is
included in the relevant chapters below.)
We have indicated where the names of individuals interviewed by Human Rights Watch (and
in some cases, other identifying information) were changed to protect their security.
As part of our research, we also sought to meet with government officials representing each
party to the conflict. In Georgia we held meetings with the National Security Council, the
Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of
Justice, and the Office of the Prosecutor General. The Georgian government also provided
written responses to Human Rights Watch letters of August 29 and November 12, 2008.
Human Rights Watch requests for meetings in Russia with the Ministry of Defense, the
Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, and the Office of the President
went unanswered. Human Rights Watch letters of October 13, 2008—sent repeatedly to the
Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, and the Office of the President
requesting answers to specific questions—also went unanswered. (See Appendix) The Office
of the Prosecutor General replied on December 21, 2009 to our request for information by
stating that the request had been forwarded to the Investigative Committee under the

The issue of civilian casualties is of great concern to Human Rights Watch, particularly when
these casualties are caused by violations of international humanitarian law. However,
Human Rights Watch did not have the capacity or expertise to carry out research to

471aa3f4,22,Part 1: Background,1.1 Background on South Ossetia,,"South Ossetia is located along Georgia’s northern frontier in the Caucasus Mountains,
bordering North Ossetia, a republic of the Russian Federation. The region is surrounded to
the south, east, and west by undisputed Georgian territories. Prior to the August 2008
conflict, South Ossetia’s population consisted of ethnic Ossetians and Georgians and
numbered some 70,000 people, 20 to 30 percent of whom were ethnic Georgians.2 South
Ossetia’s capital, Tskhinvali, had a population of about 30,000. A number of villages in
South Ossetia were overwhelmingly populated by ethnic Georgians, principally in three
valleys: Didi Liakhvi (directly north of Tskhinvali and including Kekhvi, Kurta, Zemo Achabeti,
Kvemo Achabeti, and Tamarasheni);3 Patara Liakhvi (northeast of Tskhinvali and including
Eredvi, Vanati, Beloti, Prisi, Satskheneti, Atsriskhevi, Argvitsi, Berula, and Disevi); and Froni
(west of Tskhinvali and including Avnevi, Nuli, and Tighva). A large part of the Akhalgori
district was also overwhelmingly Georgian-populated.4 With a handful of exceptions in the
west of South Ossetia, villages inhabited mainly or exclusively by ethnic Georgians were
administered by Tbilisi, while Tskhinvali and Ossetian-inhabited villages were under the
administration of the de facto South Ossetian authorities."

Soviet Socialist Republic. It sought greater autonomy from Tbilisi in the period before the
breakup of the Soviet Union. In autumn 1990 South Ossetia proclaimed full sovereignty
within the USSR and boycotted the election that brought the political party of Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, a Georgian nationalist, to power in Georgia. Gamsakhurdia’s government
responded fiercely to those developments and abolished the autonomous oblast status of

92. Direct military confrontation between South Ossetian separatists and Georgian police
and paramilitaries started in January 1991, leading to a year of skirmishes and guerrilla
warfare with sporadic Russian involvement overwhelmingly in support of the separatists. The
conflict resulted in some 1,000 dead, 100 missing, extensive destruction of property and
infrastructure, as well as thousands of displaced people, including ethnic Georgians from
South Ossetia and ethnic Ossetians from other parts of Georgia.6
(Another conflict in Georgia was fought in the early 1990s in Abkhazia, a former Autonomous
Republic of Soviet Georgia located in northwestern Georgia between the Black Sea and the
Caucasus Mountains. The 1992-93 military confrontation there led to some 8,000 deaths,
18,000 wounded, and the forced displacement of over 200,000 ethnic Georgians.7)
The first conflict in South Ossetia culminated in the region’s de facto secession from Georgia
in 1992. On June 24, 1992, in the Russian city of Sochi, Russian and Georgian leaders Boris
Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze signed an agreement that brought about a ceasefire.8 The
Sochi Agreement established the Joint Control Commission (JCC), a body for negotiations
composed of Georgian, Russian, North Ossetian, and South Ossetian representatives, and
the Joint Peacekeeping Forces (JPKFs), a trilateral peacekeeping force with Georgian, Russian,
and Ossetian units.9 These units operated under a joint command, the JPKF commander
being nominated by the Russian Ministry of Defence and appointed by the JCC. Battalion
commanders were directly appointed by each side. Although the JPKF were meant as a joint
force, in reality they were three separate battalions, deployed in different locations and more
loyal to their respective sides than to the JPKF commander.

lengthy periods of inactivity. For 12 years there was no military confrontation. After his
election in January 2004, President Mikheil Saakashvili made the restoration of Georgia’s
territorial integrity one of his top priorities. Tbilisi’s initial approach to recovering South
Ossetia was to simultaneously launch a large-scale anti-smuggling operation, aimed at
undermining the major source of income for the de facto South Ossetian leadership, as well
as a humanitarian aid “offensive” in an attempt to win the loyalty of Ossetians.10 The anti-
smuggling operation was focused primarily on closing a wholesale market near Tskhinvali, a
hub for goods smuggled from Russia that entered Georgia’s internal markets without proper
customs clearance.11 Saakashvili’s government also initiated economic and cultural projects,
including an Ossetian-language television station, pensions, free fertilizer, and
humanitarian aid.12
In the late 1990s the Russian government began proactively to offer to residents of South
Ossetia and Abkhazia Russian citizenship and to facilitate their acquisition of Russian
passports for foreign travel; by the end of 2007, according to the South Ossetian authorities,
some 97 percent of residents of South Ossetia had obtained Russian passports.13 As Russia
imposed a visa regime with Georgia in 2000, Russian passports allowed Ossetians and
Abkhaz to cross freely into Russia and entitled them to Russian pensions and other social
benefits.14"

renewed hostilities in the following months that resulted in dozens of casualties, but
stopped short of warfare.15 The parties of the JCC agreed on a new ceasefire in August 2004.
Following the August 2004 crisis, the security situation in South Ossetia remained tense,
with frequent exchanges of fire between the sides that occasionally resulted in deaths, and
increased the rate of crime.16 In another bid to alter the status quo peacefully, in late 2006
the Georgian government began strongly supporting an alternative South Ossetian
administration led by Dmitry Sanakoev.17 Following parallel presidential elections in
November 2006, two competing governments existed in South Ossetia: the secessionist de
facto government headed by Eduard Kokoity in Tskhinvali and a pro-Tbilisi government
headed by Sanakoev, based in Kurta, an ethnic Georgian village five kilometers from
Tskhinvali.18 The Sanakoev administration maintained authority over the ethnic Georgian
villages and a large part of the Akhalgori district of South Ossetia, while Tskhinvali
administered the rest of South Ossetia.
Instability and occasional skirmishes persisted,19 and negotiations between Tbilisi and
Tskhinvali within the JCC framework stalled. Georgia pushed for a change in the JCC format,
as it saw the JCC as a “three against one” arrangement: Tbilisi called for limiting Russia’s
role and insisted on participation of the European Union, United States, and Organization for

tensions between Tskhinvali and Tbilisi. The relationship between Moscow and Tbilisi was
completely severed in September 2006 when Russia, in response to Georgia's detention of
four alleged Russian spies, halted all air, land, and sea traffic with the country, and began a
widespread crackdown on ethnic Georgians. During this time, Russia expelled more than
2,300 Georgians from Russia.23
By April 2008 communication between Russia and Georgia was being restored, but Russia,
angered by Western countries’ recognition of Kosovo’s independence in February 2008 and
by Georgia’s continued efforts to join NATO, moved to deepen its cooperation with the
breakaway administrations in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.24 Georgia responded by blocking
further negotiations over Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization.25 Georgian use
of unmanned reconnaissance drones in the airspace above the breakaway republics and the
downing of one such drone by a Russian airplane on April 20 strained the relationship
further.26

Georgian and South Ossetian forces engaged in violent attacks and mutual recriminations.
In July Georgian forces hit nine residential homes in Tskhinvali and a nearby village with
artillery fire, resulting in two dead and 11 wounded. Georgia said it had been forced to return
fire after an attack. In response, South Ossetia announced a general mobilization, but halted
it within hours when Georgian forces ceased firing.27 A week later, Russia confirmed
Georgian allegations that four Russian air force jets had conducted overflights over
Tskhinvali in violation of Georgia’s airspace, a move that caused Georgia to recall its
ambassador to Russia. Russia stated that the overflights had been necessary to “cool hot
heads in Tbilisi” and prevent attempts to settle the dispute over South Ossetia through
military means.28
Military exercises conducted by both sides also contributed to rising tensions. On July 15, the
Fourth Infantry Brigade of the Georgian Army conducted an exercise near Tbilisi with US
forces, called “Immediate Response 2008.”29 On the same day, the Russian military
launched “Caucasus 2008,” a military exercise involving 8,000 troops not far from the Roki
tunnel connecting Russia and South Ossetia. While the main stated goal of the exercise was
to evaluate capacity for joint operations in connection with the terrorist threat in southern
Russia, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that, in connection with the deteriorating
situation in Georgia, it would also address issues of peace enforcement in conflict zones.30
Upon completing its military exercise, Georgia concentrated its entire artillery brigade in the
city of Gori, just 30 kilometers from Tskhinvali.31
Toward the end of July, violent skirmishes between Georgian and South Ossetian forces
became more frequent. On July 29, Georgian and South Ossetian each accused the other of
firing on the other side. On August 1, several Georgian police officers were injured in a bomb

continued to amass forces close to the South Ossetia administrative border. According to
some accounts, by the morning of August 7 there were 12,000 Georgian troops and 75 tanks
and armored personnel carriers gathered not far from the South Ossetian border.35
Fighting intensified toward the evening on August 6 and throughout August 7. Georgian
authorities claim that its forces opened fire in response to the Ossetian side firing mortars
on villages inhabited by ethnic Georgians. The de facto South Ossetian authorities claim that
Georgian forces were trying to capture a strategic hill overlooking a road connecting
Tskhinvali and several Ossetian villages.36 On the evening on August 7 President Saakashvili
announced a unilateral ceasefire.37 Hours later, however, he rescinded the ceasefire, citing
continued Ossetian shelling of Georgian villages.38"

government says its forces launched the attack to suppress firing positions from which
South Ossetian militia had attacked Georgian peacekeeping forces and Georgian villages.

moving south through the Roki tunnel in the early morning of August 7, and that they
launched the attack to prevent a full-scale Russian invasion of their country.39 Russian
authorities, however, contend that the movements at the Roki tunnel were part of normal
rotation of Russian peacekeeping troops stationed in South Ossetia,40 and that the Georgian
attack on Tskhinvali was an act of aggression against Russian peacekeeping forces and the
civilian population.41
Throughout the night between August 7 and 8, Georgian forces shelled Tskhinvali, using,
among other weapons, BM-21 “Grad,” a multiple rocket launcher system capable of firing 40
rockets in 20 seconds. Attacks intensified overnight and into the morning of August 8 as
Georgian ground forces moved toward Tskhinvali. Around 8 a.m. Georgian ground forces
entered Tskhinvali and street fighting erupted between Georgian forces and groups of South
Ossetian forces, mainly militia, who tried to stop the Georgian offensive. In the course of
the day, several villages in South Ossetia fell under Georgian forces’ control.42
During the day on August 8, regular Russian ground forces moved through the Roki tunnel
toward Tskhinvali while Russian artillery and aircraft subjected Georgian ground forces in
Tskhinvali and other places to heavy shelling and bombardment. Georgian forces bombed

During a hearing before a Georgian parliamentary commission studying the causes of the August war, several high-ranking
officials stated that President Saakashvili gave three orders at 11:35 p.m. on August 7: 1. Stop all military movement from
Russia to Georgia; 2. Suppress firing positions from which Georgian peacekeeping forces and villages were being attacked; 3.
Protect the civilian population in implementing these orders. Georgian officials further insist that Tskhinvali was not a target
per se, but that it was necessary to suppress firing positions in Tskhinvali and that Georgian forces needed to take control of
Tskhinvali to evacuate civilians located in villages to the north of Tskhinvali. See for example, “Chief of Staff Testifies Before"

and shelled Russian military targets as Russian forces moved toward Tskhinvali.43 By the
evening of August 8, Russian authorities declared that units of the 58th Army were deployed
in the outskirts of Tskhinvali and that their artillery and combat tanks had suppressed
Georgian firing positions in Tskhinvali.44 At the same time, Georgia’s President Saakashvili
declared that Georgian forces completely controlled Tskhinvali and other locations.45
Russian aircraft also attacked several targets in undisputed Georgian territory beginning on
August 8. Starting from around 9:30 a.m. on August 8, Russian aircraft attacked targets in
several villages in the Gori district, Gori city, and, in the afternoon, Georgian military airports
near Tbilisi.46
Over the next two days, Russian forces continued to move into South Ossetia, eventually
numbering by some estimates 10,000 troops with significant artillery force.47 Georgian
armed forces persisted with attempts to take Tskhinvali, twice being forced back by heavy
Russian fire and fire from South Ossetian forces, including volunteer militias. Early in the
morning of August 10, Georgian Defense Minister Davit Kezerashvili ordered his troops to
withdraw from Tskhinvali and fall back to Gori city.48

Georgian authorities insist that aerial attacks were directed against only legitimate military targets including the Gupta
Bridge linking northern and southern portions of South Ossetia, and that the Georgian Air Force did not attack any targets in
Tskhinvali. See, for example, “Chief of Staff Testifies Before War Commission,” Civil Georgia,
http://www.civil.ge/eng/_print.php?id=19851 (accessed January 15, 2009). Russian authorities, however, claim that Georgian
air attacks were used against targets in Tskhinvali as well. See, for example, “Main points of the presentation by Deputy Chief

early October, although Russian troops still occupy a village on the border.56
As Russian forces withdrew, the EU deployed a mission under the European Security and
Defense Policy, and the OSCE deployed military observers in undisputed Georgian territory

South Ossetia, however. On December 23 Russia refused to approve budgetary support for

d3ec613e,33,Part 1: Background,1.2 International Legal Framework,,"This chapter addresses the general international legal issues related to the August 2008
conflict in Georgia. This includes international humanitarian law relating to the conduct of
hostilities, humane treatment, and occupation; international human rights law; and
international law concerning displaced persons and the right to return. Discussion of
specific violations of International humanitarian law and human rights law are found within
the relevant chapters below.
International Humanitarian Law Governing Hostilities
The conduct of the armed conflict in Georgia and South Ossetia is primarily governed by
international humanitarian law, also known as the laws of war. International humanitarian
law imposes upon parties to a conflict legal obligations to reduce unnecessary suffering and
protect civilians and other non-combatants, or those hors de combat, such as prisoners. It
does not regulate whether states and armed groups can engage in armed conflict, but rather
how they engage in hostilities.60 All armed forces involved in the hostilities, including non-
state armed groups, must abide by international humanitarian law.61 Individuals who violate
humanitarian law with criminal intent may be prosecuted in domestic or international courts
for war crimes.62
Under international humanitarian law, the hostilities that occurred between Russia and
Georgia constitute an international armed conflict—a conflict between two states. The law
applicable to international armed conflict includes treaty law, primarily the four Geneva
Conventions of 1949 and its First Additional Protocol of 1977—Protocol I—and the Hague
Regulations of 1907 regulating the means and methods of warfare, as well as the rules of
customary international humanitarian law.63 Both Georgia and Russia are parties to the 1949

c9163b24,34,Part 1: Background,1.2 International Legal Framework,Geneva Conventions and Protocol I.64,"Since South Ossetia is recognized as part of Georgia, fighting between the non-state South
Ossetian forces and militia and Georgian forces falls under the laws applicable to non-
international (internal) armed conflict.65 Internal armed conflicts are governed by article 3
common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 (Common Article 3), the Second Additional
Protocol of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol II, to which Georgia is a party), as well
as customary international humanitarian law.66
Customary humanitarian law as it relates to the fundamental principles concerning conduct
of hostilities is now recognized as largely the same whether it is applied to an international
or a non-international armed conflict.
International human rights law also continues to be applicable during armed conflicts.67
Georgia and Russia are both parties to the major international and regional human rights
treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).68 These treaties guarantee all individuals
their fundamental rights, many of which correspond to the protections afforded under

64
The authoritative Commentary to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
notes that the determination of the existence of an armed conflict between states in which the conventions apply does not
depend on a formal declaration of war or recognition of a state of hostilities. Rather, the factual existence of armed conflict
between two states party automatically brings the Conventions into operation. Thus any hostilities between Georgian and
Russian forces would fall within the full Geneva Conventions. See ICRC, Commentary, IV Geneva Convention.
65
The ICRC Commentary to the Geneva Conventions lists a set of conditions that provide guidance in defining an internal
armed conflict, foremost among them whether the insurgent party “possesses an organized military force, an authority
responsible for its acts, [is] acting within a determinate territory and [is] having means of respecting and ensuring respect for
the conventions.” Ibid. South Ossetian forces clearly meet these criteria.

019a02cd,35,Part 1: Background,1.2 International Legal Framework,Basic Principles of International Humanitarian Law,"The fundamental tenets of international humanitarian law are ""civilian immunity"" and
""distinction,”70 While humanitarian law recognizes that some civilian casualties are
inevitable, it imposes a duty on warring parties at all times to distinguish between
combatants and civilians, and to target only combatants and other military objectives.71
Civilians lose their immunity from attack when and only for such time that they are directly
participating in hostilities.72
Civilian objects, which are defined as anything not considered a military objective, are also
protected.73 Direct attacks against civilian objects, such as homes, businesses, places of
worship, hospitals, schools, and cultural monuments are prohibited —unless the objects are
being used for military purposes.74
Humanitarian law further prohibits indiscriminate attacks. Indiscriminate attacks are of a
nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction.
Examples of indiscriminate attacks are those that are not directed at a specific military
objective, or that use weapons that cannot be directed at a specific military objective or that
use weapons that cannot be limited as required by humanitarian law. Prohibited
indiscriminate attacks include area bombardment, which are attacks by artillery or other
means that treat as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct
69
While in a time of war or public emergency restrictions on and derogations from many of these rights are permitted (for
example, restrictions on freedom of assembly and right to privacy), such restrictions are limited to those strictly required by
the necessity of the situation and which are compatible with obligations under international humanitarian law.

military objectives located in an area containing a concentration of civilians and civilian
objects.75
Also prohibited are attacks that violate the principle of proportionality. Disproportionate
attacks are those that are expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life or damage to
civilian objects that would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military
advantage anticipated from the attack.76
Humanitarian law requires that the parties to a conflict take constant care during military
operations to spare the civilian population and “take all feasible precautions” to avoid or
minimize the incidental loss of civilian life and damage to civilian objects.77 These
precautions include doing everything feasible to verify that the objects of attack are military
objectives and not civilians or civilian objects,78 and giving “effective advance warning” of
attacks when circumstances permit.79
International humanitarian law does not prohibit fighting in urban areas, although the
presence of civilians places greater obligations on warring parties to take steps to minimize
harm to civilians. Forces deployed in populated areas must avoid locating military objectives
near densely populated areas,80 and endeavor to remove civilians from the vicinity of military
objectives.81 Belligerents are prohibited from using civilians to shield military objectives or
operations from attack—“shielding” refers to purposefully using the presence of civilians

the grounds that it considers the defending party responsible for having located legitimate

With respect to persons within the control of a belligerent party’s forces, humanitarian law
requires the humane treatment of all civilians and captured combatants. It prohibits

Position of Peacekeepers under International Humanitarian Law
The Sochi agreement of 1992 established the Joint Peacekeeping Forces in South Ossetia
(see Chapter 1.1).90
Under international humanitarian law, as long as peacekeepers remain neutral and do not
participate in hostilities they are to be treated as civilians who enjoy protection from
attacks.91 While peacekeepers may on occasion be required to resort to use of force, such
force must be strictly limited to actions that are necessary for self defense or defense of any
civilian objects that they have a mandate under the peacekeeping agreement to protect.
Force used in this way must be strictly proportionate to that goal.
Attacks directed against peacekeepers who are not participating in hostilities would be a
serious violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime.

and the treatment of enemy combatants. Peacekeepers who use their protected status to
carry out attacks are acting perfidiously, which is a serious violation of international
humanitarian law.
During the conflict peacekeeping posts manned by Russian and/or Ossetian forces were
targeted and Human Rights Watch witnessed the extensive damage caused to the
peacekeepers’ posts by Georgian attacks.92 Both Russia and Georgia have made serious
allegations with respect to attacks on or by peacekeeping forces, none of which Human
Rights Watch was able to corroborate or refute. Georgian authorities claimed that South

The primary treaty sources of the modern law of occupation are the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949, and certain provisions of Protocol I. Much of occupation law is also a matter of customary humanitarian
law. According to the ICRC Commentary to the Geneva Conventions, the obligations of the Fourth Geneva Convention do not
require a “state of occupation,” but are in place for all relations between the civilian population of a territory and troops
advancing into that territory, that is, at the soonest possible moment. ICRC, Commentary, IV Geneva Convention, p. 60. See

International humanitarian law on occupation applies to Russia as an occupying power
wherever Russian forces exercised effective control over an area of Georgian territory,
including in South Ossetia or Abkhazia, without the consent or agreement of the Georgian
government.95 Russia also assumed the role of an occupying power in the Kareli and Gori
districts of undisputed Georgian territory until the Russian withdrawal from these areas on
October 10, 2008, because Russian presence prevented the Georgian authorities’ full and
free exercise of sovereignty in these regions.
Occupying powers are responsible for security and well-being of protected persons—those
who find themselves in the hands of a party to the conflict or occupying power of which they
are not a national.
Once an occupying power has assumed authority over a territory, it is obliged to restore and
maintain, as far as possible, public order and safety.96 Ensuring local security includes
protecting individuals from reprisals and revenge attacks. Military commanders on the spot
must take all measures in their power to prevent serious public order violations affecting the
local population. 97 In practice this may mean that occupying forces should be deployed to
secure public order until the time police personnel, whether local or international, can be
mobilized for such responsibilities. An occupying power may take such measures of control
and security as may be necessary as a result of the war.98
Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, the occupying power must also respect the
fundamental human rights of the territory’s inhabitants and ensure sufficient hygiene and
public health standards, as well as the provision of food and medical care to the population
under occupation.99 Collective punishment and reprisals are prohibited.100 Personnel of the
International Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement must be allowed to carry out their
humanitarian activities.101 Everyone shall be treated with the same consideration by the
occupying power without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on race, religion, or
95
Applying the law of occupation, or deeming Russia an occupying power for the purposes of international humanitarian law,
does not in any way affect the sovereignty of the territory. Sovereignty is not transferred to the occupying power.

recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights
conventions.108 The right to return to one’s place of origin within one’s country, or at least the
obligation of states not to impede the return of people to their places of origin, is implied.
For example, article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes
the right to choose freely one’s own place of residence, which incorporates the right to return
to one’s home area.109 In some cases, the right to return to one’s former place of residence is
also supported by the right to family reunification and to protection for the family.
Of both direct and indirect relevance to the displacement of ethnic Georgians is article 49 of
Geneva Convention IV, which maintains that civilians who have been evacuated during an
occupation “shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as the hostilities in the area in
question have ceased.” This provision is directly relevant to persons evacuated as a result
of international armed conflict; it is indirectly relevant to persons displaced as a result of
internal armed conflict insofar as it reflects the principle that parties responsible for
breaches of international humanitarian law (in those cases where evacuation or forced
displacement did not occur for imperative military reasons or for the safety of the affected
population) are responsible for redressing such violations.
Recognizing these various rights, the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection
of Human Rights has reaffirmed “the right of all refugees ... and internally displaced persons
to return to their homes and places of habitual residence in their country and/or place of
origin, should they so wish.”110 Numerous resolutions of the UN General Assembly and of the
Security Council as well as several international peace agreements also recognize the right
to return to one’s home or property.111

9a87586d,44,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.1 Overview,,"Human Rights Watch’s investigation concluded that Georgian forces committed violations of
the laws of war during their assault on South Ossetia. Our research shows that during the
shelling of Tskhinvali and neighboring villages and the ground offensive that followed,
Georgian forces frequently failed to abide by the obligation to distinguish between military
targets that can be legitimately attacked, and civilians, who may not be targeted for attack.
This was compounded by Georgia’s failure to take all feasible measures to avoid or minimize
civilian casualties. While we found no evidence that Georgian forces sought to deliberately
target civilians, Human Rights Watch research concludes that Georgian forces demonstrated
disregard for the protection of civilians during the shelling campaign, causing large-scale
damage to civilian objects and property, and civilian casualties.
In the course of three missions to South Ossetia in August, September, and November 2008,
Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 150 witnesses and survivors of the attacks on
Tskhinvali and the ethnic Ossetian villages of Khetagurovo, Dmenisi, Sarabuki, Satikari,
Gromi, Tbeti, Novyi Tbeti, Nizhnii Gudjabauri, Muguti, Monasteri, Batatykau, Kohat, Bikar,
Tsinagari and Tsairi. Human Rights Watch researchers also examined the majority of sites
where attacks took place, and gathered information from public officials, hospital personnel,
and public activists.
The mere fact of civilian casualties or destruction of civilian objects does not mean that a
violation of international humanitarian law occurred. Where civilian loss or damage occurred,
what was important to seek to determine was whether there was evidence of a legitimate
military target in the attack area, and how that target was attacked. In many cases Human
Rights Watch researchers found no evidence of military objectives in the area under attack;
other attacks did strike legitimate military targets, causing combatant and, in some cases,
collateral civilian casualties.
In a number of cases, moreover, there were no direct witnesses and no reliable information
regarding the circumstances of the attack. Also, since Georgian and Russian forces use some
identical Soviet-era weapons systems including main battle tanks, Grad multiple-launch
rockets, BMP infantry fighting vehicles, and tube artillery, Human Rights Watch could not
always conclusively attribute specific battle damage to a particular belligerent, especially for"
b88c20b5,45,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.1 Overview,Up in Flames 38,"the attacks that happened on and after the evening hours of August 8 when both Russian
and Georgian troops were present in Tskhinvali. Human Rights Watch did not include such
incidents in this report.
Yet many of the attacks on South Ossetia during the brief conflict can be clearly attributed to
Georgian forces—based on witness accounts, the direction of the attack, and the timing of
the damage in light of the advance of Georgian forces. Human Rights Watch has concluded
that a number of these attacks were indiscriminate.
The massive shelling of Tskhinvali was indiscriminate because, as will be described below,
at the very least the Georgian military effectively treated a number of clearly separated and
distinct military objectives as a single military objective in an area that contained a
concentration of civilians and civilian objects.
In some of the attacks investigated by Human Rights Watch, evidence suggests that the
Georgian forces targeted lawful military objectives (that is, objects or persons making
effective contribution to the military action) but the attacks may have been disproportionate,
because they could have been expected to cause loss of civilian life or destruction of civilian
property that was excessive compared to the anticipated military gain. In others, Georgian
forces carried out a number of artillery attacks in which they failed to take all feasible
precautions to minimize the likely extent of loss or injury to civilians.119
Georgia’s use of multiple rocket launching systems, such as BM-21s (“Grads”) in civilian
populated areas violated international humanitarian law’s principle of distinction. These
weapons cannot be targeted with sufficient precision to be accurate against military targets,
and their broad area effect makes their use incompatible with the laws of war in areas where
civilians or civilian objects (such as schools or hospitals) are located. The use of such
weapons in populated areas is indiscriminate by nature and thus prohibited under
international humanitarian law.

damage to multiple civilian objects, including the university, several schools and nursery
schools, stores, and numerous apartment buildings and private houses. Such objects are
presumed to be civilian objects and as such are protected from targeting under international
law; but as described below, at least some of these buildings were used as defense
positions or other posts by South Ossetian forces (including volunteer militias), which
rendered them legitimate military targets.122

Grad rocket attacks on Tskhinvali and outlying villages
One of the civilian objects hit by the Grad rockets in Tskhinvali was the South Ossetian
Central Republican Hospital (Tskhinvali hospital)—the only medical facility in the city that
was assisting the wounded, both civilians and combatants, in the first days of the fighting.
One of the hospital’s doctors told Human Rights Watch that the hospital came under fire for
18 hours, and that hospital staff had to take all of the wounded into the hospital basement
because of this. Human Rights Watch documented the damage caused to the hospital
building by a rocket believed to have been fired from a Grad multiple rocket launcher: the
rocket had severely damaged treatment rooms on the second and third floors.
Aivar Bestaev, the chief of the surgery department in the hospital, told Human Rights Watch,
I came to work on August 7, and couldn’t leave the hospital for almost a week.
We treated all of the wounded in the basement, because they were shelling
the hospital non-stop. We were very short-staffed, and I conducted surgery
after surgery in terrible conditions, on the cold floor in the basement. Initially,
we only had candlelight, then somebody brought a small generator… It’s a
miracle that all of the wounded (almost 280 people!) whom we treated there
survived. The majority had shell wounds, some very serious, and some had
bullet wounds as well.
On August 8, my neighbor rushed to the hospital and told me that my house
was hit and was on fire—I knew my wife was there, but I couldn’t do anything,
I was in the middle of a surgery. I had to stay in the hospital. My wife
survived—she and other women found shelter in a different house, but for
several days I didn’t know what happened to her. Everything we had burned
in the fire—clothes, furniture, everything!124

Tskhinvali. He said that five Grad rockets hit his yard and his neighbor’s yard on August 7,

See in particular, Geneva IV, article 19 which states that the “fact that sick or wounded members of the armed forces are
nursed in these hospitals, or the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet handed to
the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy.” Additionally, should the hospitals be used for
committing acts harmful to the enemy outside their humanitarian duties, protection may cease “only after due warning has
been given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit, and after such warning has remained unheeded.”

When the shelling started, [my friends] rushed to the basement, removed a
water tank and hid in the pit where it used to stand. They spent two days and
two nights there, in this pit, unable to get out. On August 10, when the
shelling subsided a bit, they went out—and just in time, because the house
totally collapsed on the same day!
As I was getting ready to return here, my kids were asking me, “Daddy, can
you please check on our toys, see if they’re all right?” What am I going to tell
them now? Sorry, children, not only your toys are gone but you don’t have a

Human Rights Watch saw several other houses on the same street destroyed or significantly
damaged by Grad rockets or artillery shells.
Another area heavily hit by the Grad rockets was the southern part of Stalin Street. There,
several apartment buildings in a row sustained multiple hits on their southern facades. One
of the residents of 96 Stalin Street told Human Rights Watch that the building was hit by
three Grad rockets almost simultaneously at around 4:20 a.m. on August 8. One of the
rockets hit an apartment on the third floor. Two of the apartment’s residents, both women,
survived with non-life-threatening injuries.127 The residents of the neighboring house, No. 98,
showed Human Rights Watch several large fragments of Grad rockets that they collected in
and around the buildings.128

heavy artillery fire by the Georgian forces.
In the village of Khetagurovo—especially in its southern part, close to the Georgian artillery
positions—Human Rights Watch saw many houses completely destroyed or significantly
damaged by the shelling. For example, one house on Alanskaia Street on the southern
outskirts of the village was hit by four Grad rockets and three mortar shells, and the
neighboring house was hit by five mortar shells. Human Rights Watch saw the fragments of
the rockets and the shell craters in the yards.
Madina Dzhioeva, age 32, one of the villagers who stayed in Khetagurovo during the attack,
described the night of August 7-8 to Human Rights Watch:
45 Human Rights Watch January 2009
At night the shelling started … My mother is very ill and bedridden. So, I had
to stay with her. When the shelling started, we spent that first night at home.
It was absolutely horrifying. Very early in the morning we carried Mother to
the house of our neighbors across the street because there is no basement in
our house, and we knew we would have been killed within hours if we stayed
at home any longer. We spent three days in our neighbors’ basement—there
was no food, nothing.129
According to Georgian authorities, and one Ossetian interviewee we spoke with, Ossetian
forces had firing positions in Khetagurovo.130 While these firing positions were legitimate
targets, given the indiscriminate nature of Grad rockets, using them to hit such targets in an
area populated by civilians may constitute an indiscriminate attack. Although the Ossetian
forces bear responsibility for endangering civilians by locating military objectives near or
among populated areas, Georgia is not relieved from its obligation to take into account the
risk to civilians when it attacks the targets.
Human Rights Watch documented similar accounts by the residents of Nizhnii Gudjabauri,
Sarabuki, Muguti, Dmenisi, and Novyi Tbeti. For example, in Dmenisi 12 houses were
destroyed or severely damaged by the shelling. In Sarabuki a Human Rights Watch
researcher saw five houses severely damaged by artillery hits, and others with lesser
damage. In both villages Human Rights Watch saw ample evidence of the use of Grad
rockets."

See above section, Tskhinvali, for a fuller discussion of this issue. The Public Commission for Investigation of War Crimes
in South Ossetia, a group of public activists working with the prosecutor’s office of the de facto South Ossetian government,
has claimed that 34 people were killed by Grad rockets or other artillery, as included on its list of 365 people killed during the
conflict. Another 65 deaths on the list are attributed to obstrel, which can mean shelling or simply “firing.” See Public
Commission for investigating war crimes in South Ossetia, “List of the Killed Residents of South Ossetia,”
http://www.osetinfo.ru/spisok (accessed November 8, 2008). As explained below, the list does not distinguish between
civilians and combatants."
0e7c9d0d,53,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.2 Indiscriminate Shelling of Tskhinvali and Outlying Villages,Up in Flames 46,"In one example, Anisim Dzhagaev, age 74, was killed by what witnesses believed to be a
Grad rocket during the shelling of Tskhinvali. On the night of August 7-8 Dzhagaev was with
his wife in the basement of their house on Kulaev Street in the southern part of the city. His
daughter Dzarisa Dzhagaeva told Human Rights Watch,
He stepped out of the basement during the shelling to see what was
happening and saw that the roof of the house had caught fire. He fetched
some water and tried to put the fire out. And then he was hit in his right leg.
Mother could hear how those multiple rockets were flying at the same time—
she described the sound of multiple explosions and everything.
He was bleeding very heavily and there was just no one to help. He was dying
slowly from the loss of blood. Mother helped him make it back into the
basement and spent the whole night sitting by his side while he was dying.
She had nothing to properly bandage the wound with, soon she ran out of
rags, and he was just bleeding away … When he died we could not bury him
properly. I made a grave for him right in the vegetable patch. I buried him
myself—but only on August 10, when the fighting subsided and I could get
out of the basement.132
Another interviewee told Human Rights Watch that his mother and aunt were killed on
August 9, during one of the last rounds of Georgian shelling. Both women were in their home,
located near School No. 6 in Tskhinvali, when a rocket hit their yard. The interviewee, Alan
Sipols, age 38, was abroad at the time of the Georgian offensive, but reconstructed the
sequence of events based on his telephone conversations with his mother just before her
death and on accounts by neighbors. A shell landed in the middle of the garden, leaving a
crater some 3.5 meters in diameter:
When it hit, all the sharp, scorching fragments flew into the house,
penetrating the walls as if it was paper. When such a fragment hits a person,
it just shreds you apart, and I cannot describe what they turned the people I
loved most into.

Sipols, who said he had had artillery training in the military, told Human Rights Watch he
believed, judging by the fragment and the crater, that the shell had been “a large-caliber
shell, some 122 mm or more,” fired from a howitzer.133
Telman Street, located in southern Tskhinvali, was almost completely destroyed by Georgian
shelling, which Sonya Gagloeva said killed one of her neighbors and wounded another.
Gagloeva, age 69, said that she was sheltering in a large basement along with many of her
neighbors. When she ran out at one point to grab her identity papers from her house, she
herself suffered a contusion and minor shrapnel wounds when a shell hit the ground right
next to her.
She said the shelling was virtually incessant during the first day, and people in the
basement had no food or water. The men tried to get out from time to time to fetch water.
One of them was killed as he was on his way out of the basement. Gagloeva said,
Our neighbor, Vasily Bazaev, he was 53 or 54 years old, tried to step outside
during that first night, close to dawn [August 8]. He made it halfway up the
staircase when a shell hit … When we came up he was still alive. We dragged
him down the stairs and he died 10 minutes later. And then we stayed in the
same basement next to his body till the afternoon of August 9, when some
relatives came to pick up the body.
Another neighbor, Natela—she’s 45 or so—got wounded. It was on August 8.
She was staying somewhere further down the street and she knew our
basement was safer, so she decided to risk it … She almost made it to us but
got hit by some fragments of shells just a few steps away from our basement.
So, we dragged her into the basement and the poor woman was all covered
in blood. We watched over her till the evening of August 9 when some of the
guys [militias] finally picked her up and took her to the hospital.134

The number of civilians at risk—and thus the number of casualties—was significantly
reduced because many residents of Tskhinvali and neighboring villages, especially women
and children, were evacuated or managed to flee their homes before the fighting began,
many of them on August 6 and 7. The majority of the remaining civilians spent several days
in the basements of their houses to seek shelter from Georgian forces’ heavy shelling and
ground offensive.
This, however, by no means relieves the Georgian side of responsibility to minimize the risk
to civilians when launching an attack and to abide by the principles of distinction.
In addition, warring parties have a responsibility where possible to give advance warning of
an attack that might affect civilians.
No such warning was given by the Georgian side. On the contrary, before the shelling started
on the night of August 7-8, President Saakashvili said in a televised statement that “Georgia
has unilaterally ceased fire in the current fighting with separatist rebels in the region of
49 Human Rights Watch January 2009
South Ossetia” and that his government would engage in direct negotiations to end the
conflict. 135
A number of witnesses told Human Rights Watch that this announcement influenced their
decision to stay in the city, which put them at greater risk."
2e7084ed,56,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.2 Indiscriminate Shelling of Tskhinvali and Outlying Villages,The positioning of Ossetian combatants,"The Georgian authorities have claimed that the strikes on Tskhinvali and neighboring
villages were legitimate as they targeted Ossetian military positions and not at civilians. In
his testimony to the parliamentary commission studying the August war, Zaza Gogava, chief
of staff of the Georgian armed forces, said that “Georgian forces used precision targeting
ground weapons only against several administrative buildings, where headquarters of
militias were located; these strikes did not cause any destruction of civilians’ houses.”136
Alexander Lomaia, the secretary of the Georgian National Security Council, told the same
commission that the goal of the attacks was only to “neutralize firing positions from
where Georgian positions were being targeted,” and that Grad rockets were only used on
“Verkhny Gorodok district of Tskhinvali, where [separatist] artillery was deployed,” while the
city center was hit with “modern, precision targeting weapons.”137
Numerous witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch, including members of South
Ossetian militias, indicated that South Ossetian forces were not only present in Tskhinvali
and neighboring villages, but also actively participating in the fighting, including by
launching artillery attacks against Georgian forces. The witnesses also made it clear that
South Ossetian forces set up defensive positions or headquarters in civilian infrastructure,
thus turning them into legitimate military targets.
These locations included some administrative buildings hit by the Georgian artillery, such as
the Ossetian parliament building, as well as several schools and nursery schools. For
example, witnesses told Human Rights Watch that militias had taken up positions in School
No. 12 in the southern part of Tskhinvali, which was seriously damaged by the Georgian fire.
Another witness said South Ossetian fighters were co-mingled with civilians in the basement

Yet another witness, a 50-year-old kindergarten teacher who showed Human Rights Watch
the fragments of Grad rockets that hit her kindergarten building on Isak Kharebov Street,
also said that volunteer militias had been “hiding” in the building.139 Several members of the
Ossetian militia interviewed by Human Rights Watch confirmed that many of the school and
nursery school buildings were used as gathering points and defense positions by the militias.
In some of the villages, such as Khetagurovo, Human Rights Watch was able to establish
that the positions of Ossetian militias were in close proximity to the civilian homes hit by the
Georgian artillery.140 Georgian forces said they came under heavy fire from Khetagurovo.
However it is questionable whether the large-scale shelling carried out by Georgian forces
against Tskhinvali and outlying villages could be considered a proportionate attack against
Ossetian forces, including volunteer militias present in these areas. In some cases, as
mentioned above, the very choice of indiscriminate weapons or weapons that cannot be
targeted with precision (such as Grad launchers) would make attacks unlawful in populated
areas. Even though the presence of the Ossetian forces may have made the area a prima
facie legitimate target, the Georgian forces were still obliged to calculate whether the risk of
harming civilians with the Grad rockets was too high to justify the military advantage sought.
It is also not clear to Human Rights Watch to what extent the Georgian command had the
necessary intelligence to establish the exact location of the South Ossetian forces at any
given moment, in part because the forces were very mobile. At the same time, Georgian
military command was clearly aware of the presence of civilians in Tskhinvali and other
areas subjected to artillery strikes.141
International humanitarian law places clear obligations on warring parties to take all
possible steps to minimize harm to civilians and not to attack civilian objects. If any doubt
exists as to whether a civilian object is being used for military purposes, “it shall be

attacking party must still make a proportionality assessment, ensuring that the expected
value of destroying the military object outweighs the likely impact of the attack on civilians
and civilian infrastructure.
142
Protocol I, art. 52(3), states, “In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as

teenage grandchildren, Dina and Aslambek, in one such attack. Dzhusoev told Human
Rights Watch that on the morning of August 8, when the shelling of the city subsided for a
while, his son decided to take his family out of the city. The civilian car (a Zhiguli Semerka)
was packed with civilians—in addition to Mairbek Dzhusoev, who was driving, there were
five children (Mairbek’s two teenagers, a six-month-old baby, a two-year-old, and a seven-
year-old), Mairbek’s wife, and another female relative. Mairbek Dzhusoev was wearing
civilian clothes. Zaur Dzhusoev, who learned the details of the incident from eyewitnesses,
told Human Rights Watch,
I didn’t want to let them go, but my son said, “Dad, not to worry, I’ll get
through!” It was around 9 a.m. He promised to call when they got out of the
city, and I was waiting and waiting for his call. I didn’t know that my children
were no longer alive …
I only found out around 4 p.m., but then I couldn’t do anything. Later I
learned from our militias who were in the area that it happened at the
intersection of Geroev and Isaaka streets. The militias noticed his car and
tried to make signals for him to turn around because there was a Georgian
tank. My son turned the car, but it was too late—the tank fired at the car, and
that was it …
Later, I saw the car—it was apparently hit by a very big shell. The two women
managed to get out with the three younger kids, but my son and
grandchildren couldn’t. Maybe they were killed instantly or maybe they died
from the wounds—no one could approach the car to help them, because

Petr Petaev, a resident of Tskhinvali, was trying to flee the city with his wife and son on
August 9. A grenade hit Petaev’s car, killing his wife and injuring Petaev and his son. Petaev
told Human Rights Watch,
For two nights and one day I was hiding in the basement with my wife and
son and then, on the 9th we could not take it anymore and decided to leave.
We got into our car in the evening and drove out of the city. Some militias
told us that a humanitarian corridor was opening up that evening and
everyone should try to leave. So, there we were driving through Tbet [Tbeti]
onto the Zar [Dzara] road.
And we were shot at right there. My wife was killed by the very first shot. My
son and I just sat in the car next to her dead body for another half-hour or so.

to ashes.” He did not know the circumstances of how the car came under fire, and found
only the burnt remains of his cousin and two of her neighbors. He said,
I immediately went there and found what remained of the car. It was a burnt
wreck. And I could not even bury [my cousin] properly. I just picked up a few
handfuls of dust from the car and pretended these were her ashes. But I
don’t know whether they were really hers or [those of the two other people in
the car]. I needed to bury something, right? And this just had to do.146
Another interviewee recounted to Human Rights Watch how his brother tried to evacuate his
wife and eight-year-old son from Tskhinvali on the night of August 7. He said,
On the detour [Dzara] road, the car came under heavy fire from the Georgian
troops. My brother first pushed his wife and son out of the car and they hid in
a ditch on the side of the road. He drove further, trying to lead the fire away
from his family. Then he jumped out of the car, and managed to crawl back to
where he left his wife and child. Georgians continued to fire at the car, and it
burnt almost completely. My brother and his family spent the night in the
ditch, and in the morning managed to get to Java, where they got some help.

Human Rights Watch was not able to conclude whether the civilian deaths that resulted from
the attacks on the vehicles were the consequence of acts contrary to the laws of war, and
believes that the circumstances of these killings warrant further investigation.
At least two factors suggest the presence of legitimate military targets. First, starting early on
the evening of August 8, Russian forces and armaments were moving south from the Roki
tunnel on the Dzara road: In a letter to Human Rights Watch, the Georgian government stated

that its forces “fired on armor and other military equipment rolling from the Roki Tunnel
along the Dzara Road, not at civilian vehicles.”148 Second, as one witness recounted to
Human Rights Watch, Ossetian forces had an artillery storage facility and firing position on a
hill about one kilometer from the Dzara road.149
Both Russian forces moving south on the Dzara road and the Ossetian firing position were
legitimate military targets. But in carrying out these attacks Georgian forces had a duty to
take precautions to minimize civilian harm and to ensure these attacks conformed to the
principle of proportionality.
The Georgian government has said that “during movement of military columns, particularly
during combat, all movement of civilian vehicles was halted. Consequently, there were no
civilian vehicles present during [Georgian armed forces] fire against the mouth of the Roki
Tunnel and along the Dzara Road.”150 It appears, however, that Russian columns moving
south did not preclude civilian vehicles’ moving north. Indeed, Georgian forces should have
been fully aware that in the first days of the conflict the Dzara road was the only way out of"

South Ossetian militiamen who were trying to get their families, neighbors, and friends out
of the conflict zone. A militia fighter is a combatant and a legitimate target when he or she is
directly participating in hostilities.
It is not inconceivable that some of the militia fighters driving civilians to safety were
wearing camouflage, were armed, or in other ways appeared to pose a legitimate threat to
Georgian forces. But it was the responsibility of the Georgian troops to determine in each
case whether the vehicle was a civilian object or not, and if it was believed to be a legitimate
military target, whether the anticipated military advantage gained from an attack on such
vehicles would outweigh the expected harm to civilians.

af8cda48,63,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.4 Georgian Forces’ Ground Offensive,,"In the early hours of August 8, Georgian ground troops, including tank columns and infantry,
entered South Ossetian villages to the west of Tskhinvali and then proceeded into the city.
While in some villages and in parts of Tskhinvali South Ossetian militias seemed to put up
armed resistance and defend their positions, by the afternoon of August 8, Georgian
authorities claimed to have complete control of the city. In Tskhinvali the exchange of fire
between Georgian forces and South Ossetian forces supported by the Russian army and air
force continued until August 10, when the Georgian command ordered withdrawal of troops
from South Ossetia.
The presence of South Ossetian combatants throughout Tskhinvali and in some villages in
many cases makes it difficult for Human Rights Watch to assess the legality of some of
Georgia’s attacks during the ground offensive. Armed with automatic weapons, the militias
targeted Georgian military vehicles and infantry moving through the city. Numerous
witnesses confirmed to Human Rights Watch that virtually all able-bodied males joined the
volunteer militias, often after moving their families to safety in North Ossetia.151
Human Rights Watch believes that, particularly during the attempt to take Tskhinvali, on a
number of occasions Georgian troops acted with disregard to the protection of civilians by
launching attacks where militias were positioned that may have predictably caused
excessive civilian loss compared to the anticipated military gain. Some of the Georgian
soldiers interviewed by Human Rights Watch confirmed that while they were targeting
Ossetian fighters who were shooting at them from apartment buildings, they were fully
aware of the presence of civilians in these buildings. One soldier said,
We entered Tskhinvali in the morning of August 8. There was a street fight.
Ossetians were mostly in the buildings, in apartments, and shot at us from
the buildings. We could see civilians in the basements. Some would come up
and peek out to see what was happening on the street level. Then they would
go back down. The fighters were also in the basements and would fire at us
from the basements.152

Human Rights Watch researchers saw multiple apartment buildings in Tskhinvali hit by tank
fire. In some cases, it was clear that the tanks and infantry fighting vehicles fired at close
range into basements of buildings. Human Rights Watch interviewed several people who
were sheltering in these basements at the time of the attack.

Street, Tskhinvali, which he explained suffered severe damage during the Georgian ground
offensive. The wall of the building had a gaping hole at the basement level, apparently from
a shell fired at close range. Giorgi G. said,
When the fighting started, everyone who remained in the building rushed to
the basement. We stayed there for the next two days, unable to step outside
because the shelling was so heavy. On August 9 a BMP [infantry fighting
vehicle] fired right into the basement, leaving a gaping hole in the wall. The
noise was deafening and debris was flying all over the place. My neighbor’s"

broke his legs. No one was killed because everyone was in the adjacent
room. 153
Even when the presence of Ossetian militias meant that apartment buildings could be
legitimate targets, it was not apparent from the evidence of the aftermath of the attack that
the Georgian military had taken all feasible precautions to minimize the harm to civilians.154
It is clear, however, that the military tactics they used caused civilian casualties and
significant damage to civilian property.
For example, residents of Tselinnikov Street in Tskhinvali told Human Rights Watch that at
around 3:30 p.m. on August 8 a Georgian tank opened fire at their apartment building, after
a group of Ossetian militia started withdrawing through the neighborhood. Six tank shells hit
the building, destroying five apartments, and killing an elderly man, Erdish Kulumbegov."

lived on the fourth floor, didn’t manage to make it to the basement in time.
His apartment was hit by a shell and caught fire. When the attack was over,
we went upstairs and saw that the old man burned to ashes. We … buried
[his] remains in the yard.155
Neighborhood residents told Human Rights Watch that the attack did not result in any
casualties among the militia, with whom they were all acquainted.156
Similarly, in some villages, the Georgian offensive seemed to have been carried out with
little regard to the safety of civilians. Ossetian militias fled their positions in villages as
Georgian ground troops started their offensive. Human Rights Watch has no information
about street fighting that ensued between these Ossetian fighters and Georgian forces.

Ossetian forces left the village of Khetagurovo, where they had firing positions, just prior to
Georgian ground forces’ entry into the village on August 8. Human Rights Watch researchers
learned that as the Georgian infantry entered the village they were spraying the gates and
fences of homes with bullets, demanding that the militias surrender. Hundreds of bullet
holes were clearly visible on fences and gates. According to witnesses, on August 8 one of
the stray bullets killed an elderly woman, Anastasia Dzhioeva, as she went to feed the
chickens in her yard.157
One villager, Mokhmed Maldigov, told Human Rights Watch,
At dawn, around 5 a.m. or so, the Georgians entered the village—first the
tanks, and then the infantry. They were shooting in all directions. One [tank]
shell hit my house. People were so frightened. Many started running, women
and kids in particular. And they just continued shooting.158
Novyi Tbeti, a village of about nine houses on the outskirts of Tskhinvali, was almost
completely destroyed by Georgian artillery and tank fire. One villager, 63-year-old Izolda
Galieva, told Human Rights Watch that all of the young men, including her sons, had joined
the militia and gone to the city, and only women and elderly stayed in the village when the
Georgian army entered it on August 8. Galieva described the ordeal she and her neighbors
suffered:
On Friday [August 8] at around 6:30 in the morning I saw two Georgian tanks
on the street and one car full of gunmen. Then one of those tanks fired for the
first time—right at my house, and I just dropped to the floor and crawled to
the basement. The Georgians were shooting from machine guns and
submachine guns, and screaming obscenities. When a tank [shell] hit my
house directly the house just fell apart, and I got shrapnel wounds on my
neck and arms. I was flat on the basement floor, bleeding and afraid to
move …
The neighboring house was also destroyed by tank fire on that day, and my
neighbors, the Makaevs, husband and wife, both got shrapnel wounds. The
tanks fired 15 times or so—and now, as you can see, the whole village is

Monday afternoon [August 11], when some neighbors looked into the
basement and found me. They told me that the Georgians had all fled, and
dragged me out. Then, an ambulance came for me and took me to the
hospital.159
The Conduct of Georgian Troops during the Ground Offensive
The majority of witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch did not complain about other
types of violations against them by the Georgian forces. Judging by their statements, in most
cases the troops entering the villages did not deliberately cause physical harm to civilians.
Several Ossetian interviewees said that Georgian soldiers told them they were under orders
to look for and pursue Ossetian militias, but to spare women, children and elderly during the
ground offensive.
Zareta Z., from the village of Sarabuki, said that when Georgian soldiers entered the
basement where she was hiding with her husband, they told them, “Now you’ll live with us,
with Georgians, and we’ll live in peace. Misha [Saakashvili] told us not to touch women and
children. We’re instructed to kill the young guys [fighters] only. And that’s what we’ll do. You
are not to worry.”160 Another woman from the same village, “Svetlana S.,” also said that the
Georgian soldiers were telling the residents, “We have not killed any residents and we are
not going to! Everyone is safe!”161
Madina M. from Khetagurovo said that she was terrified when Georgian troops entered the
village, but to her surprise they were “polite” and did not harm her. She said,
They were going from yard to yard and looking for young guys. They did not
know our guys weren’t around anymore. I was so frightened … I thought
they’d be doing cruel things to women and to the elderly, like during the first
war, back in 1992. But they were … polite, really. They kept saying that they
had an order not to touch women, children, and old people, and we had
nothing to fear from them. They were so young—seemed to be 19 or 20, no

more than that. Those who came into our basement even told us, “We don’t
want to die either.”162
Several women from five mountain villages in Akhalgori district populated mainly by
Ossetians also confirmed that the Georgian forces did not harm civilians when they entered
the villages on the night of August 7-8.163 A woman from Tsinagari told Human Rights Watch,
They told us not to be afraid and said that if our men wouldn’t shoot, they
wouldn’t shoot either. They shot in the air—probably trying to frighten us.
They entered the houses, checked identification documents, even some of
our neighbors’ passports. They also looked for young guys and for the men.
But all our men were already gone by then—they joined the militia and hid in
the woods. The Georgians were also looking for firearms but our men had
taken their weapons with them, so there was nothing much to find.164
A small number of witnesses from different villages complained, however, that the Georgian
forces ransacked their houses as they were looking for Ossetian fighters, and in a few cases
took money, valuables, Russian identification documents, or other things from the residents.
For example, Slavik Gabuzov, age 71 and disabled, told Human Rights Watch that when
Georgian ground forces arrived in Znauri on August 8 they came to his home looking for
fighters and arms. They treated him roughly and stole money:
All my family left on the 7th but I stayed behind because I cannot walk
properly and traveling is pretty much impossible. The Georgians came in the
morning of the 8th. Their tanks were all over the place. Three of them came to
my place and said, “Are you Georgian?” I said, “No, I’m Ossetian.” So they
pointed their submachine guns at me and put me against the wall, with my
crutches and all.
They demanded that I give my weapons to them. But what kinds of weapons
were they thinking of finding, an old handicapped man like me? When I told
them I had no weapons they ordered me to drop flat on the ground. They
yelled all kinds of obscenities and mocked me. They searched my place and

open it for them and took all the money. 165
A young woman from the village of Tsair told Human Rights Watch that Georgian soldiers
stole whatever money she had at the house, as well as the passports of the residents, all of
whom have Russian passports.166 A resident of Muguti, 75-year-old Fenya Dzhioeva, said that
when Georgian forces searched her home they “tore everything apart.” She managed to
retrieve money she had hidden under her mattress, but as she was putting it into her pocket,
“they still noticed and took [it] from me.”167
International humanitarian law applicable to the conflict prohibits looting or pillaging, and
individuals and commanders involved in such acts may be responsible for war crimes.168

b56612fd,70,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.5 Georgia’s Use of Cluster Munitions,,"The Georgian military attacked Russian forces with cluster munitions to stop their forward
advance into South Ossetia. Human Rights Watch has no information about the impact of
these attacks on civilians in South Ossetia.
Human Rights Watch did find that M85 cluster munitions hit nine villages in undisputed
Georgian territory, which killed at least four people and injured eight. In addition,
unexploded M85s have prevented civilians from tending or harvesting their crops, causing
them to lose a source of income and subsistence. Human Rights Watch has concluded that
these cluster munitions were fired by Georgian forces. Several factors suggest that Georgian
forces did not target these villages, but rather that the submunitions landed on these
villages due to a massive failure of the weapons system (see below). Even though injuries
that result from failure of a weapons system do not mean that there has been a violation of
humanitarian law, the incidents demonstrate the excessive and indiscriminate harm that
can be caused to civilians, and why therefore progress is being made to ban the use of
cluster munitions as a means of warfare.169
Cluster munitions are large, ground-launched or air-dropped weapons that eject, depending
on their type, dozens or hundreds of bomblets, or submunitions, and spread them over a
large area. Because cluster munitions cannot be directed at specific fighters or weapons,
civilian casualties are virtually guaranteed if cluster munitions are used in populated areas.
Cluster munitions also threaten civilians after conflict: because many submunitions fail to
explode on impact as designed, a cluster munitions strike often leaves a high number of
hazardous unexploded submunitions—known as duds—that can easily be set off upon
contact.
In a letter to Human Rights Watch on August 31, 2008, the Georgian Ministry of Defense
acknowledged that it had used cluster munitions against Russian military equipment and
armaments as they were moving south from the Roki tunnel. The ministry insisted, however,
169
In May 2008, 107 nations meeting in Dublin, Ireland, adopted a new international treaty, the Convention on Cluster
Munitions, which comprehensively bans the use, production, trade, and stockpiling of the weapon. The new treaty opened for
signing on December 3 and 4, 2008, and by the close of the signing conference in Oslo, Norway, 94 nations had done so. It
will become binding international law six months after 30 signatories have ratified it. Even though neither Georgia nor Russia
was part of the process developing the treaty, the use of cluster munitions is strictly limited by previously existing
international humanitarian law on indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks."
1aea24be,71,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.5 Georgia’s Use of Cluster Munitions,Up in Flames 64,"that cluster rockets “were never used against civilians, civilian targets and civilian populated
or nearby areas.”170
The Georgian Ministry of Defense identified the type of cluster munitions used as the GRAD-
LAR 160 multiple launch rocket system with Mk-4 rockets with M85 submunitions: In a
document sent to Human Rights Watch on November 18, the ministry reported, “Georgian
Armed Forces used 24 packages (13 shots in each) of GRAD-LAR munitions during the
Georgian-Russian August war.”171 First Deputy Minister of Defense Batu Kutelia told Human
Rights Watch that these weapons, bought from Israel, are the only cluster munitions in
Georgia’s possession.172 M85 submunitions are not reported to be part of Russia’s arsenal,
and international deminers refer to the M85s they found in Gori and Karaleti districts as
“Georgian.”173 Notwithstanding the cluster munition hits in Gori district, Kutelia expressed
satisfaction with how the munitions performed and said that they delayed Russian troop
advances by several days.174
One witness interviewed by Human Rights Watch claimed that Georgian forces used cluster
munitions in their attacks on the Dzara road in South Ossetia. The witness, a member of the
Ossetian militia who had been assisting in the evacuation of civilians on that road,
described seeing “a rocket which exploded in the air, and then small clusters started
exploding.”175 Human Rights Watch was not able to independently verify this claim, yet such
allegations need to be further investigated.
The Russian authorities did not respond to a written request from Human Rights Watch for
information about Georgian use of cluster munitions in South Ossetia (See letter in
appendix).

Based on the timing and location of the M85 cluster strikes, the presence of Georgian troops in the area at the time of the
strikes, and the fact that Russian troops entered the area contaminated with unexploded M85 submunitions only days after
the M85 strike, Human Rights Watch initially attributed the strikes to Russian forces. On September 3, after the submunitions
were conclusively identified as M85s by the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment (NDRE), Human Rights Watch issued
a statement withdrawing that attribution.

detonated submunitions, and Mk-4 rockets in Gori district. They interviewed villagers who
had fallen victim to M85 submunitions, deminers who work in the area, and senior
government officials. Through these sources, researchers gathered evidence of M85s in a
band of nine villages in the north of the Gori-Tskhinvali corridor: Brotsleti, Ditsi, Kvemo Khviti,
Megvrekisi, Pkhvenisi, Shindisi, Tirdznisi, Zemo Khviti, and Zemo Nikozi.176
Georgian First Deputy Minister of Defense Batu Kutelia told Human Rights Watch that the
presence of M85 submunitions in villages in the Gori district remained a mystery to the
Georgian authorities. According to Kutelia, Georgia will conduct an investigation into the
situation and seek the assistance of the company that sold it the M85s—presumably Israel
Military Industries, the only Israeli manufacturer of M85s.177 One theory is that the M85
submunitions landed in these villages because of a massive system failure. Based on
Kutelia’s description of the incidents, the rockets fell short of their minimum range. The
failure theory would explain why they landed where they did (witnesses did not report
Russian troops in the area at the time of attack), and why the dud rate was so high."
9a9e554a,72,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.5 Georgia’s Use of Cluster Munitions,Civilian Casualties from M85s,"M85 submunitions are Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) whose
purpose is to injure or kill persons and pierce armor. It is an unguided weapon that poses
grave danger to civilians in part because of its inaccuracy and wide dispersal pattern. These
submunitions are cylinder-shaped; civilians often describe them as resembling batteries or
light sockets. Connected to the top of each of these submunitions is a white or red ribbon
that unfurls when the submunition is released.
At least one civilian was killed and two wounded as the M85 submunitions landed in Gori
district villages. On the afternoon of August 9, Vano Gogidze, age about 40, was killed and
his brother, Ketino, 38, was injured when M85 submunitions exploded as they landed in the
village of Shindisi.178

A villager also showed Human Rights Watch an Mk-4 rocket and red ribbon in Variani, but because the town is further
south and does not fit the geographic pattern of the other findings, Human Rights Watch has not determined whether the
rocket actually landed in Variani.

when M85 submunitions landed around 3:30 a.m. on August 9:
I heard some noise. I came out of my front door. There was a loud shooting
noise and I came out to see what was happening. I heard screams and came
out to see if someone was wounded. As soon as I came out, something
exploded. I turned back and shrapnel hit my back, stomach, leg. I started
bleeding. My kids were inside the house. I tried to cover them. My wife
treated me first and stopped the bleeding. In the morning I went to … Tbilisi. I
was released [from the hospital] in a couple days.179
Zerekhidze showed Human Rights Watch three small craters and a fragmentation ring that he
had found in front of his house. The craters were consistent with a submunition explosion,
and Human Rights Watch identified the ring as belonging to an M85 submunition."
7e041101,73,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.5 Georgia’s Use of Cluster Munitions,Casualties from unexploded duds,"There are at least two versions of the M85 submunition: one with a self-destruct device and
one without.180 The unexploded M85 submunitions that Human Rights Watch discovered in
Gori district villages did not have a self-destruct device. First Deputy Minister Kutelia told
Human Rights Watch that he was surprised about this finding and similar findings by his
own engineers. According to Kutelia, Georgian authorities had been told that the munitions
that they had bought had self-destruct devices.181
Human Rights Watch has documented that at least three people were killed and six
wounded by M85 duds that exploded upon contact in Shindisi, Pkhvenisi, and Brotsleti.
On August 10, several men from Shindisi decided to inspect one of the sites where the strike
had landed the previous day. They found a piece of unexploded ordnance with a red ribbon,

Although the reported failure rate under test conditions for the M85 submunition with a self-destruct device is 1.3 to 2.3

From the very beginning of the conflict, Russian authorities put significant effort into
documenting alleged violations by Georgian forces. An investigation is being conducted by
the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation Prosecutor’s Office (Sledstvennyi"
713a0823,76,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.6 Russian Allegations against Georgia of Genocide and,"Komitet Prokuratury, or SKP).","During his August 10, 2008 meeting with the head of the SKP, President Dmitry Medvedev
stated that “the actions of the Georgian side cannot be called anything other than
genocide,” and ordered the SKP to document the evidence of crimes committed by Georgian
forces in South Ossetia in order to create a “necessary basis for the criminal prosecution of
individuals responsible for these crimes.”186 The SKP then opened a criminal investigation
under article 357 of the Russian Criminal Code (“genocide”), having already initiated an
investigation under article 105 (“premeditated murder of one or more persons”).187 The SKP
deployed over 200 investigators and 29 forensic experts to conduct an investigation in
South Ossetia. On September 25 the head of the SKP reported that the evidence-gathering
phase of the investigation had been completed and that “[t]he investigative work allowed us
to come to an unequivocal conclusion that the goal of the aggressors was the total
annihilation of the national group of Ossetians residing in South Ossetia.”188
Human Rights Watch does not have access to the SKP’s investigative files and thus cannot
assess the evidence gathered and the validity of these allegations. Human Rights Watch’s
written requests to the Russian government to meet with the prosecutor’s office went
unanswered.

Information collected by Human Rights Watch suggests that while the actions by the
Georgian forces clearly violated international humanitarian law, they did not amount to the
crime of genocide. 189 This opinion seemed to be shared by the rapporteurs of the Committee
on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by Member States of the Council of

and prepared a report to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). During

(“thousands” according to early numbers cited by the Russian authorities
relying on “provisional data”) seem to be much exaggerated; … Individual
atrocities such as those described in certain Russian media and submissions
to the Committee of Ministers would be serious crimes in their own right, but
not attempted genocide.190
Some statements attributed to SKP representatives also raise serious concerns about the
accuracy and thoroughness of the investigation. For example, reporting on the findings of
the SKP on August 21, Rossiiskaya Gazeta (the main official Russian newspaper) wrote,
In the village of Tsinagar[i], the aggressors executed all civilians in a church
where they tried to find refuge. According to Archbishop Feofan of Stavropol
and Vladikavkaz, Georgian soldiers were dragging pregnant women out of
houses and beating and killing them for delectation of the crowd. One
Tskhinvali resident was trying to protect her child from the Georgians, but the
baby was shot dead right in her lap.191

Genocide is defined in international law as acts—such as killings, causing serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately
inflicting on a group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, imposing

attributed the same incident to the village of Dmenisi instead.193 However, numerous
Ossetian villagers interviewed by Human Rights Watch in that village said they never heard
about, let alone witnessed, such an incident.194
Human Rights Watch researchers were told similar hearsay accounts of atrocities allegedly
committed by Georgian troops in other villages of South Ossetia, but our follow-up research
did not confirm these allegations. For example, in August, right after the end of hostilities,
several people told Human Rights Watch that civilians were burned to death in a church in
Khetagurovo. When Human Rights Watch visited Khetagurovo, local residents vehemently
denied such allegations. A staff member of the South Ossetia Committee for Press and
Information told Human Rights Watch that the incident actually happened in Sarabuki.195 Our
researchers immediately traveled to Sarabuki, only to discover that local residents had not
even heard that story.196
Similarly, hearsay allegations of rape circulated widely in South Ossetia, but no leads
provided to Human Rights Watch produced credible results.
Accusations of atrocities and genocide allegedly committed by the Georgian troops were
also widely publicized by the Public Commission for Investigating War Crimes in South
Ossetia, a group of Russian and South Ossetian public activists working with the
prosecutor’s office of the de facto South Ossetian authorities.197 The commission was
created on August 12, 2008, and immediately went to Tskhinvali and started interviewing
witnesses and collecting other evidence of violations committed by Georgia.

evidence of the rape allegations has come to light.

72be423e,80,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.7 The Issue of Civilian Casualties in South Ossetia,,"From the very beginning of the conflict, controversy has surrounded the issue of the numbers
of civilian casualties resulting from the Georgian forces’ assault.
Early Figures from Russian and South Ossetian Officials not Borne out
From August 8, 2008, the day after the conflict started, Russian and South Ossetian officials
repeatedly cited figures of civilian deaths ranging from 1,400 to more than 2,000. For
example:
• On August 8 President of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity said that “slightly more than
1,400 people have been killed,” claiming that the figure was based on reports from
relatives;
• On August 9 Russian Ambassador to Georgia Vyacheslav Kovalenko said that “at
least 2,000 residents of Tskhinvali have died”;
• On August 10 Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Grigory Karasin said that
“according to the latest data, as a result of Georgia’s assault against South Ossetia
at least 2,000 people, most of them Ossetians, have died”;
• On August 11 Russian Foreign Ministry official Boris Malakhov said that “as a result
of Georgia’s armed assault on South Ossetia about 1,600 civilians were killed”;
• On August 20 Irina Gagloeva, a spokesperson for the de facto South Ossetian
authorities, said that “according to refined data, 1,492 residents of South Ossetia
died as a result of Georgia’s assault.”200
These early, high casualty figures grounded the genocide claims Russia adduced to justify
its military intervention. They also significantly influenced public sentiment in South Ossetia.
For example, some of the local residents interviewed by Human Rights Watch justified the
torching and looting of the ethnic Georgian enclave villages by referring to “thousands of
civilian casualties in South Ossetia,” as reported by Russian federal TV channels.
To date, neither Russian nor South Ossetian officials have made clear how these figures
were compiled and what evidence supports them. Nor have they acknowledged that later

estimates. The various later figures include the following:
• The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation Prosecutor’s Office (SKP)
announced on August 21 that it had documented the deaths of 133 individuals,201
increased the figure to 159 as of October 12,202 and to 162 as of December 23,"

Committee established by PACE to study the situation in Russia and Georgia, stated
on September 29, 2008 that “independent reports put the total number of deaths at
between 300 and 400, including the military,” adding that “these figures are far
lower than those initially advanced in particular by Russia,” and suggested that “all
sides agree that the initial high numbers were inflated.”204
• Christos Pourgourides, the rapporteur of the PACE’s Committee on Legal Affairs and
Human Rights, also reported on October 1, 2008 that “the number of Ossetian
(civilian) victims of the Georgian assault (‘thousands’ according to early numbers
cited by the Russian authorities relying on ‘provisional data’) seem to be much
exaggerated.”205

of people killed in the conflict that, as of November 8, contained the names of 365
individuals.206

who may have been killed in hostilities. As of November 8, the prosecutor’s office had verified that 365 of these 1,692 were
deaths. The public commission member noted that the figure could be expected to change as more information gradually
became available about the remaining 1,327. The commission also receives information updating its list through calls to its
hotline. Human Rights Watch interview with Olga Kostina, representative of the Public Commission for investigating war

Civilian versus combatant unclear in Russian figures
It is not clear whether the SKP’s investigation is distinguishing between civilians and
volunteer Ossetian militias, and if so, how (Ossetian peacekeepers and servicemen of the
South Ossetian Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Defense and Emergencies, and
Committee for State Security are explicitly excluded). According to Olga Kostina, the key
spokesperson for the Public Investigation Commission on War Crimes in South Ossetia, the
commission list does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties.207
During our research in South Ossetia, Human Rights Watch found that witnesses often
referred to the members of the militias as “civilians,” meaning that they were volunteer
fighters, as opposed to servicemen of the South Ossetian Ministry of Internal Affairs,
Ministry for Defense and Emergencies, and other agencies. However, under international
humanitarian law, they are combatants and not civilians.
The Public Commission’s list contains 74 women (including elderly women), 37 elderly men
(age 60 or over), and seven minors (under age 18). One can reasonably conclude that many
of these individuals were individuals who did not take part in the hostilities. The status of
the remaining 247 needs to be verified. The list does not contain dates and times of death,
place (in most cases), and includes very limited information regarding the cause of death
(for example, “killed during hostilities,” or “killed by shrapnel”).
Erroneous Georgian Figures for South Ossetian Civilian Casualties
The Georgian government, for its part, inaccurately and repeatedly stated that a total of 44
civilians had been killed during Georgia’s military assault. Georgian officials, including
President Saakashvili, incorrectly attributed this figure to a Human Rights Watch press
release (see below). These attributions ceased after Human Rights Watch sent letters to the
Washington Post (where one such attribution appeared) and to President Saakashvili
explaining that we had made no such assessment.208"
55e1bb99,82,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.7 The Issue of Civilian Casualties in South Ossetia,Human Rights Watch and Casualty Figures,"Human Rights Watch does not have the capacity to make a definitive estimate as to the

7b04629d,83,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.7 The Issue of Civilian Casualties in South Ossetia,Up in Flames 76,"conflict is an issue of great importance, Human Rights Watch’s major concern in any conflict
setting is to establish whether and how civilians have been killed or injured and, more
particularly, whether this was the result of violations of international humanitarian law.
During our first investigation in South Ossetia Human Rights Watch collected some figures
on individuals killed and wounded as a result of the conflict—both through interviews with
relatives of the victims and by obtaining data from hospitals and local officials.
For example, in August Human Rights Watch interviewed a doctor at Tskhinvali hospital who
said that the hospital received 44 bodies, of fighters and civilians, between August 6 and 11,
all from Tskhinvali. The hospital had the only morgue in the city.209 The doctor told us that
between August 6 to 12 the hospital treated 273 wounded, both militias and civilians,
brought from the city and some neighboring villages. She said her hospital was the only
medical facility treating the wounded in Tskhinvali. The doctor said there were more South
Ossetian forces than civilians among the wounded, and added that all of the wounded were
later transferred (to North Ossetia). As of August 13, there were no wounded left in Tskhinvali
hospital.210
The 44 figure became the subject of controversy as some mistakenly characterized this as
Human Rights Watch’s definitive figure on civilian casualties, and others used this as
evidence of bias. We were fully aware and noted in media statements that the figures
provided from Tskhinvali hospital were not a comprehensive tally. Some of the residents
killed in Tskhinvali and especially in the outlying villages were never brought to the hospital;
instead, a number of people were buried beside their homes.211
At the same time, Human Rights Watch continues to question the initial 1,400-2,000 figures
and the methodology used to arrive at them. We have emphasized that these were not
reliable figures because it was not clear how such figures were compiled so quickly, as early
as August 8 and 9, under chaotic circumstances. We also expressed concerns about the
effect these announcements had on public sentiment in South Ossetia.
Finally, and most importantly, Human Rights Watch believes that this issue requires further
research, as new information might reasonably come to light about whether deaths were the

result of humanitarian law violations, about deaths not reported previously (including
deaths in the intervening period from wounds inflicted during the conflict), and might also
identify people who were assumed dead but were in fact missing and resurfaced, and
people who were inadvertently counted twice.
It is the obligation of the Russian investigative authorities to ensure transparency on this
matter and provide both the Russian public and the international community with the latest
accurate information—if necessary, by correcting the statements made by government
officials at the beginning of the conflict."
2e7ed822,85,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.8 Georgian Detentions and Ill-Treatment of Ossetians,,"The Georgian military during active combat in South Ossetia detained at least 32 Ossetians.
These 32 were released between August 21 and 27, in exchange for Georgian civilian
detainees. At the request of the South Ossetian authorities, nine Ossetians previously
convicted of crimes and held in Georgian prisons were also exchanged for Georgian
civilians.212
Human Rights Watch interviewed five of the 32, whom the Georgian military had detained on
August 8 and 9.213 All five detainees reported having been beaten by Georgian soldiers at the
moment of their detention, and receiving poor and inadequate food while in detention.
The Georgian government maintains that all 32 Ossetians were militia fighters and were
detained for their participation in hostilities.214 Human Rights Watch cannot definitively
determine whether the Ossetians detained by the Georgian military were civilians or were
participating in hostilities. The Georgian authorities have not presented evidence that all of
the Ossetians whom they detained were in fact combatants. At least one case investigated
by Human Rights Watch, that of an elderly man who said he was a pacifist on religious
grounds, calls into question the Georgian government’s blanket determination about those
whom its forces detained. One interviewee, however, made no effort to conceal that he was
a combatant—he told Human Rights Watch that he was from North Ossetia and traveled to
South Ossetia to join the militia forces as a volunteer immediately before the Georgian
military attacked Tskhinvali.
Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, civilians are considered to be protected persons. The
Convention requires that “persons taking no active part in the hostilities, … shall in all
circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, color,
religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.” 215 During hostilities and
occupation, the Fourth Geneva Convention permits the internment or assigned residence of

on reasonable security grounds, detentions must be carried out in accordance with a regular
procedure permissible under international humanitarian law. Those detained have a right to
appeal their internment and have their case reviewed every six months. The Fourth Geneva
Convention provides detailed regulations for the humane treatment of internees. The
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) must be given access to all protected
persons, wherever they are, whether or not they are deprived of their liberty.217
Under international humanitarian law Ossetians who were not members of any regular forces,
but members of militias or otherwise took up arms against the Georgian military, are not
entitled to POW status, but are detained as non-privileged combatants, and should be
treated in accordance with the protections guaranteed to civilians under the Fourth Geneva"

obligation to guarantee protections set out in the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Both the ICCPR and ECHR
provide an absolute prohibition on torture and other degrading or inhuman treatment.218 In
cases documented by Human Rights Watch, the Georgian authorities’ ill-treatment of
Ossetian detainees violated this prohibition. The provisions of the ICCPR and ECHR banning
arbitrary detention are also applicable, as during the conflict Georgia did not derogate from

Human Rights Watch has received allegations from both Ossetian and Georgian authorities
about instances of hostage-taking during the conflict and since the end of hostilities.220
International humanitarian law strictly forbids hostage-taking, which is defined as holding or
threatening someone to compel another party to do or not do something.221 Hostage-taking

Watch that Georgian military forces detained him on August 9 at approximately 9 a.m. in the
village of Khetagurovo. He described his detention:
They surprised me in the street, threatened to kill me, shot in the air several
times, and pointed their guns at me. I had no other choice but to surrender.
They took my car, two cellphones, and all the cash that I had on me: 10,320
[Russian] roubles [US$380]. I was armed and in my police uniform … but I
tried to explain that … I had nothing to do with the armed fighting.… They just
started beating me.223
The Ministry of Defense of Georgia maintains that Tikaev was one of three Ossetian field
commanders detained by the Georgian military.224
When a Russian military convoy began to approach Khetagurovo, the Georgian military
forced Tikaev and several other detainees to walk to Avnevi. Tikaev described to us his
transfer from Avnevi to Gori and Tbilisi:
In Avnevi they put me and [another detainee] Leonid Dzhioev into a truck,
tied us to the seat and handcuffed us to a side rail. The truck took us to Gori,
where we were handed over to the military police. From there we were
transported to Tbilisi. They were beating me over and over before the [military]
police claimed us. They were really beating me all the time in Avnevi, in
Karteli, on the way to Gori. My right hand is still all numb and does not work
properly [as a result of the beating].225

Sergei Lokhov told Human Rights Watch that he was detained on August 9 in Khetagurovo.
He said that he was unarmed, but Georgian soldiers ignored his efforts to explain that he
was a civilian. Lokhov said Georgian soldiers beat him at the moment of his detention, and
described the beating to Human Rights Watch:
They asked me, “Why are the Russians bombing us?” … [and], “Who’s your
president?” I said, “Kokoity?” They hit me and asked again. And I said, “Do
you mean Putin?” So they hit me again. It’s only later that I realized they
wanted me to say “Saakashvili.”226
Tikaev confirmed that when he saw Lokhov in detention at the Vasiani military base, Lokhov
bore signs of beating. Tikaev told Human Rights Watch, “There was another man from
Khetagurovo held with me, Sergei Lokhov. He is in his late forties ... Sergei was treated worst
of all. When I saw him [in detention] … I was so scared. His jaw was dislocated from the
beating, and he was in a very bad state.”227
Diana Dzhabieva, interviewed by Human Rights Watch in the village of Muguti, stated that
one of her neighbors, Nodar Butlotaev, also reported having been beaten by Georgian
soldiers when they detained him in Khetagurovo on August 8 (Dzhabieva spoke with
Butlotaev following his release on August 22). Butlotaev told Dzhabieva that Georgian forces
beat him, including in the head with the butt of an automatic weapon, resulting in an open
head wound.228"

090d4ef2,89,Part 2: Violations by Georgian Forces,2.8 Georgian Detentions and Ill-Treatment of Ossetians,Detentions in the Znauri district,"Human Rights Watch interviewed two individuals who were detained on August 8 in the
Znauri district, west of Khetagurovo. Tengiz Bakaev, age 66, from Batatykau, stated that
Georgians entered the village in the early morning, shooting and entering houses searching
for fighters and weapons. The village was nearly deserted except for Bakaev and his wife.
Both Bakaev and his wife stressed that he did not take part in the hostilities because of his
age and religious convictions. Bakaev described his detention to Human Rights Watch:
When the Georgians entered the house … my wife hid somewhere in the
yard.… I told them weapons were wrong and fighting was wrong. I am a
Christian, a Pentecostal, and we abhor fighting. And they asked what kind of
passport I have, and I told them, “A Russian one and an Ossetian one.” They
said, “You’ll be coming with us.” I said, “I won’t go,” and they hit me in the
head and dragged me off… On the way to Kareli I was beaten, but not as
badly as the other guys who were … with me. Probably because I was older …
But they did beat me on my face and on my back with their fists and gun
butts.230
Georgian forces detained Zaza Lakhtilashvili, who is half Georgian, in Znauri on August 8.
Those who know him told Human Rights Watch that Lakhtilashvili is mentally disabled, and
although Human Rights Watch is not qualified to make assessments about an individual’s
medical state, our impression of him was consistent with what his acquaintances said.231
When Georgian forces asked for his name, Lakhtilashvili became confused and, thinking the
soldiers were Russian, gave the name Gobozov, his Ossetian mother’s maiden name, rather
than his Georgian last name. After Lakhtilashvili told the soldiers that he had killed four
Georgians, the soldiers beat and detained him. He described his ill-treatment to Human
Rights Watch: “[The Georgian soldiers] beat me up first and took me away with them. They
hit me and hit me again.… They took me away and held me someplace.”232

Vasiani military base, near Tbilisi. Other Ossetian detainees were held in facilities under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice, including four pretrial detention facilities, Prison No. 8
in Tbilisi, and the central prison hospital.233 The Georgian government maintains that
persons detained in the context of the conflict were placed separately from other prisoners
in newly constructed or newly renovated facilities. It has stated that detainees had three
meals daily, which met “accepted nutritional requirements,” unlimited access to water, and
access to medical services when needed or requested.234 The government also told Human
Rights Watch that the ICRC had unimpeded access to the facilities in which Ossetian
detainees were kept, and visited two: the Vaziani base and Prison No. 8.235 The government
stated on December 3, 2008, that to date it had received no complaints of abuse from"

inadequate food in detention. Tikaev briefly described to us his detention at the Vasiani
military base:
I was held in … Vasiani on their military base. They have a sort of a
guardhouse there and that is where they held [us]. There were 18 of us
altogether. They fed us very poorly. We were hungry all the time. They only
gave us a piece of bread, a quarter of a chicken or a piece of sausage a day,
plus water and dried crusts.237

Tengiz Bakaev and Zaza Lakhtilashviili were exchanged by the Georgian authorities for

during and immediately after the conflict remain in Georgian custody.242
According to Zoya Kabisova, her son, 29-year-old Tomaz Kabisov, was last seen in the village

described above.
Bosikov told Human Rights Watch that he first saw Tomaz Kabisov when Kabisov was
brought on August 8 to the prosecutor’s office in Gori, where several Ossetian detainees
were held overnight. Bosikov said that the next day he and several other detainees,
including Kabisov, were taken to a detention facility in Khashuri, a town west of Gori. He told

3ff12aa1,93,Part 3: Violations by Russian Forces,3.1 Overview,,"Human Rights Watch has concluded that Russian forces committed violations of
international humanitarian law during their attacks and hostilities in South Ossetia and in
undisputed Georgian territory. Russian forces attacked areas in undisputed Georgian
territory and South Ossetia with aerial, artillery, and tank fire strikes, some of which were
indiscriminate, killing and injuring civilians. All Russian strikes using cluster munitions were
indiscriminate. With regard to many aerial and artillery attacks, Russian forces failed to
observe the obligations to do everything feasible to verify that the objects to be attacked
were military objectives (and not civilians or civilian objects) and to take all feasible
precautions to minimize harm to civilians. In one case, Russia attacked medical personnel, a
grave breach of the Geneva Conventions which is a war crime.
In several incidents involving military force against civilian vehicles, Russian forces may
have intentionally targeted civilians. Deliberate attacks on civilians amount to war crimes.
In many of the incidents of aerial and artillery attacks documented in the next chapter
Human Rights Watch found evidence of violations of humanitarian law. The mere fact of
civilian casualties or destruction of civilian objects does not mean that a humanitarian law
violation occurred. In each case, Human Rights Watch sought to determine whether there
was evidence of a legitimate military target in the attack area, and if so how that target was
attacked. In many cases Human Rights Watch researchers found no evidence of military
objectives in the area under attack; other attacks did strike legitimate military targets,
causing combatant and, in some cases, collateral civilian casualties.
With regard to attacks on ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia, since Georgian and
Russian forces use some identical Soviet-era weapons systems including main battle tanks,
Grad rockets, BMP infantry fighting vehicles, and tube artillery, Human Rights Watch could
not always definitively attribute specific battle damage to a particular belligerent, especially
for the attacks that happened on and after the late afternoon of August 8, when both
Russian and Georgian troops were present in Tskhinvali. Human Rights Watch did not
include such incidents in this report.
87 Human Rights Watch January 2009
Several local residents told Human Rights Watch that many of the Russian servicemen who
occupied Georgia behaved in a disciplined manner and in some cases even protected the
civilian population from Ossetian forces, militia members, or looters. Nevertheless, Human
Rights Watch documented four incidents in which Russian servicemen committed such
violations as pillaging, destruction of civilian property, and using violence against civilians;
we documented four cases where they did so jointly with Ossetian forces.
Russia failed in its duty as an occupying power to ensure as far as possible public safety and
order in areas under its effective control in South Ossetia.247 This allowed South Ossetian
forces, including volunteer militias, to engage in wanton and widescale pillage and burning
of Georgian homes and to kill, beat, rape, and threaten civilians. This violence is
documented in Chapter 4.
247
For a discussion of the obligations of the law of occupation, see Chapter 3.7, Russia's responsibility as occupying power."
312823b0,95,Part 3: Violations by Russian Forces,"3.2 Aerial Bombardments, Shelling, and Artillery Attacks",,"Between August 8 and 12, Russian forces attacked Georgian military targets in Gori city and
in ethnic Georgian villages in both South Ossetia and undisputed Georgian territory, often
causing civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects such as houses or apartment
blocks. The proximity of these targets to civilian objects varied. In several cases, the military
targets that were within meters of civilians and civilian homes, and the attacks against them
resulted in significant civilian casualties. In other cases the apparent military targets were
located as far as a kilometer away from civilian objects, and yet civilian casualties also
resulted. In attacking any of these targets the Russian forces had an obligation to strictly
observe the principle of proportionality, and to do everything feasible to assess whether the
expected civilian damage from the attack would likely be excessive in relation to the direct
and concrete military advantage to be gained. In many cases the attacks appear to have
violated the principle of proportionality. In yet other cases, Human Rights Watch investigated
but was not able to identify any legitimate military targets in the immediate vicinity. The
absence of a military target in the vicinity of an attack raises the possibility that Russian
forces either failed in their obligation to do everything feasible to verify that the targets were
military and not civilian; that they were reckless toward the presence of civilians in their
target zone, or that Russian forces deliberately targeted civilian objects.

In some cases in South Ossetia, civilian casualties and damage to civilian property in
Georgian villages were caused by artillery shelling. Because both Russian and South
Ossetian forces possessed artillery capacity, Human Rights Watch was not always able to
establish with certainty whether responsibility for indiscriminate artillery attacks lay with
Russian or South Ossetian forces. In these cases further investigation is required to
determine specific responsibility for violations of international humanitarian law.
Attacks on Ethnic Georgian Villages in South Ossetia
Residents of several ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia said their villages had been
shelled intermittently by South Ossetian forces in the days leading up to the conflict. From
August 8 (after the Georgian assault started) until August 10, the villages were subjected to
more intense artillery shelling—by either Russian or South Ossetian forces—and to Russian
aerial bombardments. Because of the attacks, many villagers fled in the early stages of the
conflict. In most villages, however, some elderly and infirm people remained. Even though
Georgian military forces reportedly remained deployed in some of these villages until August
9, the attacks warrant further investigation to determine whether the attacks were
indiscriminate and therefore in violation of international humanitarian law."
d7de20bc,97,Part 3: Violations by Russian Forces,"3.2 Aerial Bombardments, Shelling, and Artillery Attacks",Kekhvi,"Four Kekhvi residents described a mix of artillery shelling and aerial bombing of the village
lasting from August 7 to 9.248 Tamara Mamagulashavili, 41, told Human Rights Watch,
The shelling started on August 7, at 11:30 p.m. There were no gunshots, just
the blast. It was from artillery and it blew out the windows. My husband and I
lay down on the floor. Then we went with six others to our neighbor’s
basement [to hide]. The shelling lasted the entire night; it was only artillery.
There was about 10-30 minutes between each blast. It came from different
directions.
At 6 a.m. the aerial bombing started. These bombs made more noise and you
could hear them as they were coming in. There was aerial bombing until 3
p.m. Then it stopped until 6 p.m., but the artillery shelling continued. At
about 6 p.m. on August 8 we decided to leave the village.249
Three other residents of Kekhvi interviewed by Human Rights Watch also described heavy
bombing and shelling of the village.250 One of them, Slava Melanashvili, 32, a construction
worker, told Human Rights Watch,
On August 9 massive bombing started and the village administration and
hospital buildings were destroyed. Bombing took place day and night. It
seemed like they were targeting a local school and other large buildings;
maybe they thought there were troops hiding there. My house was hit and
completely destroyed during the bombing in the afternoon of August 9. My
house was next to the village school.251

The Georgian government pointed to the shelling of Kekhvi in the days prior to August 7 to explain its military intervention

However, in the attack the forces also hit three five-story apartment buildings also on
Sukhishvili Street near the base, killing 14 and wounding dozens.256 Each of the three
apartment buildings was hit directly in the center of the building, suggesting that the
Russian aircraft specifically targeted these buildings in addition to the military base.257
Georgian authorities had a duty to the extent feasible not to place a military base in close
proximity to civilian areas. However, Russian forces still had a duty to take into account the
effect on the civilian population of their attack and to observe the laws of war in relation to
targeting and proportionality. Russian forces therefore had an obligation to do everything
feasible to verify whether the apartment buildings, which should be presumed to be civilian
objects, were in fact military targets. The circumstances of the attack raise doubts as to
whether this determination was made.

were hit by shrapnel and died. She was pregnant. Their six-year-old-son was
badly wounded, but survived.259
Lia Kobesashvili, 45, worked as a nurse for an ambulance dispatch service that was located
in one of the apartment buildings. She told Human Rights Watch, “People were thrown out of
the windows. There was complete panic. Many people were wounded. One nurse who lived
at 10 Sukhishvili Street, Maia Vazagashvili, was killed when the pressure threw her out of
the window.”260"

the school when it was attacked. To his knowledge none of the reservists was injured. 261 The
reservists as combatants were a legitimate target, and it is possible that the school was
deemed as being used for military purposes. In such circumstances, it would lose its status
as a protected civilian object. In the attack, one strike hit an apartment building next to the
school, killing at least five civilians and wounding at least 18, and another hit a second
building adjacent to the school causing damage, but no civilian casualties.

reservist forces in the yard. Suddenly a bomb hit the building next to the

building was destroyed. The school building was damaged.262
While the reservists’ presence in the school yard rendered it a legitimate target for the
Russian forces, questions may be raised as to the proportionality of the attack. Where an
object, which is by its nature normally civilian, becomes used for military purposes, it can be
attacked, but only by means that will avoid or minimize harm to civilians and damage to
civilian objects. All feasible measures should be taken to cancel or suspend an attack if it
becomes apparent that the expected civilian casualties would outweigh the importance of
the military objective.263"

remained in the city to take care of the hospital’s remaining patients.264
At around 2 a.m. on August 13 a Russian military helicopter fired a rocket toward a group of
hospital staff members who were on break in the hospital yard. The rocket hit Giorgi
Abramishvili, an emergency room physician in his forties. Abramisvhili, who had spent the
previous four days operating on people wounded during the war, died from head injuries.
Human Rights Watch researchers saw that the roof of the hospital building is clearly marked
with a red cross, the “distinctive emblem” indicating medical personnel or facilities and
entitled to specific protection under the Geneva Conventions.
This attack was a serious violation of international humanitarian law. Hospitals, even
military hospitals such as the one in Gori, are not legitimate military targets. The wounded

On the morning of August 9 Russian air and artillery attacks struck the village of Karbi. At
about 7 a.m. an airstrike killed one villager.266 Two hours later, as residents started gathering
in one part of the village in preparation to flee, another round of aerial-burst artillery shells
killed at least seven and injured at least 10.267
Avto Unapkoshvili, 48, was wounded during the first attack, when a bomb struck his house.
The bomb killed Unapkoshvili’s relative, Dodo Unapkoshvili, age 60, who was asleep in the
house. Avto Unapkoshvili told Human Rights Watch, “My brother and I were standing outside
the gates [to our house], smoking, around 6:30 a.m. It was completely quiet; then I heard an
explosion and saw yellow smoke. The pressure from the explosion was so strong that it lifted
me up, and then I fell to the ground.”268

When I approached them, I heard loud explosions and I was wounded. My arms, stomach
and leg were bleeding. My son was also wounded.”271
Vasiko Tevdorashvili, the village administrator, described to Human Rights Watch the
aftermath of the second attack: “There were many wounded. I had to decide who had better
chances of survival and stuff them into the ambulance. We buried the dead in the yards of
houses and fled the village.”272
According to Vasiko Tevdorashvili and two other villagers, there was no Georgian military
base in the village and there were no Georgian military forces present at the time of the
attack. Two other villagers, interviewed separately, told Human Rights Watch that while there
were no Georgian troops in the village itself, there was Georgian artillery in fields about three
kilometers from the village.273
The distance of the village from the Georgian artillery, combined with the fact that the village
was hit twice in two separate attacks, suggests that the village may have been deliberately
targeted, or at a minimum that the village was hit as part of an indiscriminate attack on the
area, and the Russian forces failed to direct the attack solely at the military targets located at
some distance from the populated areas. In either event the civilian casualties in Karbi
appear to be the result of serious violations of humanitarian law."

Raisa Ketiladze’s 43-year-old son Zaza was wounded during the bombing. She recounted,
I was sitting in the yard of my house eating ice cream when I heard noise
from flying jets. We did not expect them to bomb us as our village is located
far from the conflict zone and away from the main road. But rockets started
flying, hitting one house after another. I heard my son screaming for help,
shouting that he was wounded. I could not see him as the air was full of
debris.
When we found him he was wounded in the leg. My neighbors helped me
carry him first to the fields to hide. When the bombing stopped we took him
to the hospital in Rustavi where they operated on him.278
While it has not been possible to establish the total number of rockets Russian forces fired
in their attack, villagers told Human Rights Watch that a demining organization had cleared
148 S-8 rockets, many of them unexploded, in Tortiza during the first weeks of October. Lali
Masuradze, 45, told Human Rights Watch, “In every house, they cleared stuff.”279 Zina
Ketiladze, 72, told Human Rights Watch that four rockets fell in her house alone. She showed
Human Rights Watch researchers the remaining craters and described the attack:
I heard jets flying over. I was alone at home and decided to run away, and
that’s when the first one fell in my yard. It broke the windows and doors. The
debris was so thick in the air that nothing was visible. I started screaming for
help and ran to the fields. Later I found out that four rockets fell in my yard.280
Villagers told Human Rights Watch that there were no Georgian military or police forces in
the area. Human Rights Watch examined the damage to many houses in the village which,
together with witness accounts, provided compelling evidence that Russian aircraft fired at
civilian houses.

As in Tortiza, these attacks on Tkviavi and Akhaldaba may have been a direct attack on what
were purely civilian targets. If so, these would be war crimes. At a minimum they appear to
have been indiscriminate attacks in that if the attacks were directed at forces outside of
either village all feasible measures were not taken so as to target only the military objects,
and the attacks were not carried out in such a way as to avoid or minimize civilian casualties.

cee9e178,109,Part 3: Violations by Russian Forces,3.3 Russia’s Use of Cluster Munitions,,"In the course of three missions to Georgia in August, September, and October 2008, Human
Rights Watch researchers found that Russian forces used cluster munitions against targets in
populated areas in the Gori and Kareli districts just south of the South Ossetian
administrative border, killing at least 12 civilians and injuring at least 46 at the time of attack.
Unexploded cluster submunitions in the contaminated areas have prevented many farmers
from harvesting, throwing already struggling farmers into deep economic distress.
Because cluster munitions cannot be directed at specific fighters or weapons and because
cluster duds will likely injure or kill whoever disturbs them, combatant or civilian, using
cluster munitions in populated areas, as Russia did, should be presumed to be
indiscriminate attack, which is a violation of international humanitarian law.284
The lawfulness of a military strike may also be determined by whether the effects on civilians
are excessive in relation to any direct military advantage gained. As noted elsewhere in this
report, a cluster strike will be an unlawfully disproportionate attack if the expected civilian
harm outweighs anticipated military advantage. The expected civilian harm is not limited to
immediate civilian losses, but also encompasses casualties over time. There is greatly
increased likelihood that the loss will be excessive in relation to the military advantage
when taking into account both strike and post-strike civilian harm, especially if an attack
occurred in a populated area or an area to which people might return. Based on its field
research in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Lebanon, as well as in Georgia,
Human Rights Watch believes that when cluster munitions are used in any type of populated
area, there should be a strong, if rebuttable, presumption that the attack is disproportionate.
Finally, parties to a conflict are under the obligation to take “all feasible precautions in the
choice of means and methods” of warfare so as to avoid and in any event minimize
“incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.” The
indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions makes it impossible for a party using cluster
munitions in populated areas to observe this principle.
284
For a decription of cluster munitions, see Chapter 2.5, “Georgia’s Use of Cluster Munitions”.
103 Human Rights Watch January 2009"
23d2d437,110,Part 3: Violations by Russian Forces,3.3 Russia’s Use of Cluster Munitions,Evidence of Russian Cluster Use,"Russian authorities have not acknowledged using cluster munitions during the August war
with Georgia. On August 15 the deputy chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the
Russian Federation, Anatoly Novogitsyn, stated that Russia had not used cluster munitions
“in the area of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict.”285 Responding to a question from a journalist
in October, a spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not deny that Russian
forces had used cluster munitions, but instead pointed out that “the Georgian side has
cluster warheads in service.”286
However, Human Rights Watch researchers gathered overwhelming evidence that several
villages in Gori and Kareli districts had been hit by air-dropped RBK-500s and RBK-250s
carrying AO-2.5 RTM submunitions and by Hurricane missiles carrying 9N210 submunitions.
Human Rights Watch also found that Gori city had been struck by an Iskander SS-26 ballistic
missile carrying submunitions.
Human Rights Watch has concluded that these strikes were Russian. The weapons systems
in question are produced in Russia and are known to be in Russia’s arsenal. Even though
Georgia possesses cluster munitions (see Chapter 2.5, Georgia’s Use of Cluster Munitions),
there have been no reports that Georgia possesses these particular weapons systems. While
the Georgian authorities admit to possessing the GRAD-LAR 160 multiple launch rocket
system with Mk4 rockets with M85 submunitions, they deny that they are in possession of
any other cluster munitions.287 Finally, witnesses told Human Rights Watch that Georgian
troops, likely targets for a Russian cluster munitions strike, were or had been passing
through the area of the strike, although they were not in the immediate vicinity of the strike.
Conversely, no Russian troops, likely targets for a Georgian strike, were reported in the area.
International deminers working in the area concurred with Human Rights Watch’s conclusion
that the cluster munitions strikes in question were Russian.288

41c337e3,111,Part 3: Violations by Russian Forces,3.3 Russia’s Use of Cluster Munitions,Up in Flames 104,"Human Rights Watch documented three cluster munition strikes that resulted in civilian
casualties. In two cases (Gori city and Variani), the cluster munition strikes were directed
against public squares where numerous civilians had gathered. In a third case (Ruisi), the
strike was directed against the center of a town. In these three cases, the cluster munition
strikes killed at least 12 civilians and injured at least 46.
Even though Georgian troops were moving through the general area, Human Rights Watch
has not been able to identify any potentially legitimate military targets in the immediate
vicinity of these strikes. All witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch insisted that there
were no Georgian troops in the immediate vicinity at the time of the strikes. In the absence
of military targets in the immediate vicinity, Human Rights Watch has concluded that the use
of cluster munitions against targets in these populated areas constitutes at best
indiscriminate use of force.
The military advantage achieved by the strikes is also questionable because Georgian
military troops were already retreating at the time of the strikes. As a result, Russian use of
cluster munitions was likely disproportionate and therefore illegal under international
humanitarian law.
Although Human Rights Watch has not documented any casualties from unexploded Russian
cluster submunitions, using such a weapon indiscriminately against troops in populated
areas posed—and because of the presence of unexploded submunitions, continues to
pose—foreseeable threats to civilian lives.
Variani—RBK-500 cluster munitions with AO-2.5 RTM submunitions
At least two cluster munition strikes hit the village of Variani during the conflict, killing three
people and injuring 16. Variani is situated along one of the two main roads between
Tskhinvali and Gori city. Based on statements from victims and witnesses and physical
evidence gathered on the ground in the form of unexploded submunitions, remnants of
delivery rockets, and numerous fragments from the weapons system (including the
submunitions’ signature ring of “fins”), Human Rights Watch has concluded that Variani was
struck by RBK-500 cluster munitions loaded with AO-2.5 RTM submunitions.289
289
RBK-500 is an air-dropped cluster munition that carries 108 AO-2.5 RTM anti-personnel and anti-materiel submunitions.
The AO-2.5 RTM submunition is roughly oval in shape and has a distinctive ring of “fins” around its middle. Human Rights
Watch cannot exclude that other air-dropped munitions may also have been dropped in Variani.

The first attack struck in the center of Variani around 10:30 a.m. on August 8. Teimuraz
Khizanishvili, 70, was one of more than a dozen civilians who were in the public square for a
daily gathering when the attack occurred. He told Human Rights Watch that Malkhaz
Bedoshvili, age about 31, who was standing a few meters away from him, died immediately
while his father, Omar Bedoshvili, about 65, was wounded and died several hours later in
hospital. Khizanishvili was himself injured during the attack: “The bomb fell from the air and
it exploded. It happened in seconds and we all fell down. Both my legs were broken. There
was shrapnel everywhere in my body—my forehead, hand, legs, torso, back.”290 When he
spoke to Human Rights Watch Khizanishvili was sitting in a wheelchair with his legs in large
casts.
Three children were also among the wounded. Beka Giorgishvili, 13, was playing with his
friend Valiko Urjumelashvili, 12, when the attack occurred. They were both injured together
with Urjumelashvili’s nine-year-old sister Tsira. Valiko Urjumelashvili lost part of his skull in
the explosion, and when Human Rights Watch spoke with his mother in October she said he
still had shrapnel in his head and had difficulties speaking.291"

occurred in Variani on August 8. On August 12, at the time of the second attack, Georgian
troops had retreated from Tskhinvali and reportedly had left Gori city, located several
kilometers south of Variani, already the night before. While some villagers with whom
Human Rights Watch spoke said Georgian troops might have been in the fields surrounding
Variani, they said there were none in the town at the time of the attacks.294
Unexploded submunitions from Russian cluster attacks have prevented farmers from
harvesting their crops, the only or primary livelihood for many residents of Gori and Kareli
districts. Tamar Eremov, a 68-year-old farmer in Variani, was looking for walnuts on her land
when she found an unexploded AO-2.5 RTM. “[Contamination] has interfered with my harvest.
I couldn’t collect because I couldn’t get into my fields because they were occupied [by
troops]. Now I’m afraid to go in because of the ordnance.”295 Eremov worried that the
submunitions would soon prevent her from harvesting her tomatoes, beans, and corn.

Ruisi—Uragan (Hurricane) rockets with 9N210 submunitions
Russian forces struck the villages of Ruisi on August 12 using Uragan rockets carrying 9N210
submunitions.297 This conclusion by Human Rights Watch is based on numerous interviews
with witnesses and victims, as well as physical examination of the contaminated areas by
Human Rights Watch researchers who found remnants of delivery rockets, unexploded
9N210 submunitions, and numerous fragments from exploded 9N210 submunitions. We
made the same conclusion about the villages of Dzlevijvari (struck on August 11, around 11
a.m.)298 and Pkhvenisi,299 based on a witness account from the former and physical evidence
of 9N210s we found in both.
In Ruisi, the cluster munition strike occurred between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on August 12,
killing three civilians and injuring six others.
On the morning of August 12, Suliko Goginashvili, 65, took his cattle to the field to graze. His
wife, Iza Goginashvili, 57, who found Suliko in the field after the cluster strike, told Human
Rights Watch, “When we found him he had numerous wounds. His head was broken. His
brains were out. His legs and hand were sliced off.”300 Kvicha Saatashvili, a 45-year-old
carpenter who lives in Ruisi, showed Human Rights Watch a canister for 9N210 that he found
about 100 meters from the place where Goginashvili died. He also found identical small
cylindrical fragments in his home.301 Natela Guraspashvili, about 75, died in the same field
as Goginashvili.302
That morning, Ushangi Beruashvili, 68, had just left Ruisi to go to Kareli. When the bombing
started Beruashvili decided to return to Ruisi to seek cover in a house about 300 meters from
the place where Goginashvili died. He recounted,

fins” at the base. Its core is surrounded by identical, small cylindrical metal fragments, encased in rubber, that shoot out in
every direction.

Beruashvili spent several days in hospital with other cluster munition victims from Ruisi.304
On the other side of Ruisi, not far from the village church, Amiran Vardzelasvhili, 79, father of
seven, was also killed in the cluster strike. His daughter Marine was at home when the strike
occurred:
Planes were flying around and dropping bombs, like that: “boom, boom,
boom”—we heard bombs exploding in different places. People were
screaming and crying. We could feel the blast waves from the explosions—it
was right near our house. There weren’t any troops in the village at that
moment, they were just bombing the village. Suddenly, we heard our father
screaming, “Gela!”—he was calling for his son. We ran out and saw him—my
father was on the ground, all covered in blood. He died on the spot from
shrapnel wounds.305
The same attack injured four women who had moved toward the church and the cemetery, in
the belief that the church would not be targeted. All four women were injured. The injured
women and neighbors showed Human Rights Watch an Uragan rocket and 9N210 fragments

anticipating food distribution from local officials in the Gori municipal administration
building located on the square.308 A car accident on the square attracted even more civilian
onlookers, and a group of journalists had stopped on the square to ask for directions. One
victim estimates that there were at least 40 civilians on the square when the cluster
munitions attack took place.309
According to Paata Kharabadze, chief doctor of the Gori civilian hospital, six people were
killed during the attack.310 The injured were initially taken to the Gori civilian hospital but
were evacuated to Tbilisi due to the deteriorating security situation in Gori. The Gudushauri
National Medical Center of Tbilisi admitted 24 civilians from Gori that day, many of them
injured in the morning’s attack.
Victims of the attack described to Human Rights Watch how they saw numerous small
explosions within seconds before they fell to the ground. Keti Javakhishvili, 25, told Human
Rights Watch that she went with her neighbors to get bread and was injured in the attack:
“There was a big explosion above us and the next moment there were many smaller
explosions everywhere.”311 Dr. Merab Kiladze, head of the surgery department of the
Gudushauri National Medical Center, told Human Rights Watch that Javakhishvili suffered
massive trauma to her liver, stomach, and intestines, as well as hemorrhagic shock.312
Nodar Mchedlishvili, 54, told Human Rights Watch that he went to the municipality building
to get food to feed eight people displaced from South Ossetian villages: “In a couple of
seconds from everywhere I heard what sounded like massive gunfire. We fell on the ground
and some people never got up.” Mchedlishvili sustained shrapnel wounds to his left leg and
knee. Giorgi Malkhaziani, 59, whose right leg was shredded as a result of the attack,
corroborated Mchedlishvili’s account of the events.313

The Gori city square is a large open space with a statue of Stalin (who was born in Gori) at
the center. On one side of the square is the municipal administration building, and on the
other sides are apartment buildings with shops on the ground floor. Even though the main
command center for the Georgian military operation in South Ossetia was located in Gori, all
Georgian troops had left the city by the evening of August 11, according to witnesses. All
witnesses said that there were no military forces on the square when it was attacked.
One of those killed in the August 12 cluster munitions strike on Gori’s main square was Stan
Storimans, a cameraman for the Dutch television station RTL. On August 29 the Dutch
Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched an investigative commission consisting of military and
diplomatic experts to Gori to investigate Storimans’s death. The commission writes in its
report,
During the on-site investigation, the mission was able to establish that the
entire square and several nearby streets had been hit in the same manner.
An area of about 300 by 500 metres was struck by small metal bullets
[fragments] measuring about 5 mm. It was deduced from the entry holes that
the bullets were from multiple explosions, both on the ground and in the
air.314
Having analyzed video material taken by Reuters and security cameras at two banks by the
square, the commission concluded that “the square and surrounding area were hit by about
20 explosions at around 10:45 a.m., and that each explosion scattered a large number of
bullets. The explosions can be seen to occur both in the air and on the ground.”315 Based on
visual characteristics, the serial numbers found on the missile pieces and the nature of the
strike, the commission concluded that Russian forces had hit the square with an Iskander"

South Ossetia, though this would not preclude that it had been used against a target in
another part of Georgia, such as Gori.317 Presented with the findings of the Dutch
investigative commission, the Russian authorities asserted that there was not enough
evidence to conclude that Storimans had been killed as a result of the use of weapons by
the Russian side.318

villagers’ homes.319 Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that there were no Georgian military
personnel in their houses at the time that the tank fire took place.320
One witness described an incident in which tanks methodically moved through the streets,
firing on numerous houses in a row, suggesting that the fire was not directed at specific
military targets and that such attacks were indiscriminate.
According to Manana Gogidze, 48, of Tamarasheni, on August 9 at around 10 a.m. Russian
soldiers entered the house where she and nine others were hiding, checked for armed men
and left. Soon after, she saw Russian tanks roll down the street. “Three tanks would stand
one after another, point their barrels in different directions and start shooting at houses,”
Gogidze told Human Rights Watch. “They would shoot at houses … and then would move on
down the street, doing the same.”321
Around the same time that day, 65-year-old Luiza Nasuashvili was in her home in
Tamarasheni when a Russian tank fired on it. Nasuashvili told Human Rights Watch that
soon after Russian troops had entered Tamarasheni, “All of a sudden I heard a big explosion
and a big hole appeared in my house. I think it was tank fire. Debris fell on my head as I lay
down on the floor.”322 Nasuashvili fled her house and was immediately detained by a
member of the Ossetian forces.

If there were such forces present, their presence would render civilian objects such as houses legitimate military targets.
But even in such circumstances, the presence of any Georgian military would not relieve Russia of its obligation under
international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to minimize the harm to civilians, and to verify that the
particular objects were legitimate military targets. This principle of customary international law is codified in Protocol I of the
Geneva Conventions, art. 57 (2). Russia also had an obligation to do everything feasible to assess whether the expected
incidental loss of civilian life or damage to civilian property of an attack would be excessive with respect to the direct and
concrete military advantaged to be gained.

intentional firing on civilian vehicles that posed no apparent military threat.
Aerial attacks on civilian convoys near Eredvi, South Ossetia
Human Rights Watch interviewed several civilians who fled from different villages in South
Ossetia on August 8 in convoys of civilian cars traveling south in the direction of undisputed
Georgian territory. The convoys came under aerial bombardment by military aircraft that was
possibly Russian near the village of Eredvi, along a road that bypasses Tskhinvali.
Witnesses traveling in one convoy of several dozen cars told Human Rights Watch that on
August 8, around 4 p.m., five Russian aircraft flew over the convoy, then returned and
opened fire. According to witnesses, there were no military objects, military personnel, or
military vehicles on the road at the time of the attack.
Temo Kasradze, from the village of Kemerti, who was fleeing with his grandson, described
the attack: “There were five people in our car. Suddenly [there was an] explosion. Perhaps
four or five cars were hit... I saw that people were injured and killed. There was blood.”323
Jemal Maisuradze, 45, travelling in the same convoy, described the attack similarly: “It was
an aerial attack. There were five [Russian] planes. They first flew over once, then came back
and opened fire, before they left... There were no military troops around. All the vehicles
were civilian.”324

road in Eredvi, Magaldadze saw three explosions about 20 to 25 meters in front of the
vehicle. Magaldadze did not remember hearing any aircraft, but, because there were three
explosions shortly after each other, he concluded the explosives had been fired from a jet.327
At the time of these attacks Georgian forces were deployed in South Ossetia and Georgian
military aircraft had not yet been grounded. Russian forces have not acknowledged carrying
out these attacks. However, Human Rights Watch has concluded that these attacks were
more than likely carried out by Russian forces. The attacks occurred on cars moving south
towards undisputed Georgian territory along a road bypassing Tskhinvali and running
through Eredvi, an ethnic Georgian village, and in the area of several other ethnic Georgian
villages (prior to the conflict, ethnic Georgians regularly utilized this road in order to avoid
Ossetian villages and checkpoints around Tskhinvali, and continued to do so during the
conflict). Witnesses stated that there were no Ossetian or Russian military positions in that
area that would have been targeted by the Georgian military.
There can also be little doubt that the attacks on the civilian convoys near Eredvi violated
international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch is not aware of further information that
would indicate the presence of legitimate Georgian military targets in the vicinity of the
attacks described above, making them indiscriminate. It also cannot be excluded that the
attacking forces deliberately targeted civilians, which would constitute a war crime.

Russian forces fired on the taxi in which they were riding. Mamuka Berkatsishvili, the taxi
driver, was driving the two women in his blue Opel from Gori city north toward Shindisi so
that Garsevanishvili could check on her house (she had fled several days earlier).
Berkatsishvili later told Nino Garsevanishvili, Dodo’s daughter, what happened:
They got to Tedotsminda, and started going up the hill when they saw
Russians coming the other way. Mamuka told me that Russians fired without
any kind of warning. Mamuka fell from the car. The car turned over, but

As the aircraft started attacking the tower as well, the director of the television tower,
Vakhtang Shavdatuashvili, and a relative decided to drive Khekhelashvili and Papuashvili
back to the village. As recounted by Khekhelashvili, on the way the car (a white Zhiguli)
came upon three tanks—each with about eight soldiers sitting on top—driving toward them:
When we reached parallel with one of the tanks, without any warning a
soldier sitting on the tank opened fire on us with his gun. I felt a bullet skim

my right leg.
The three wounded men eventually managed to get to Akhaldaba, which was occupied by
Russian forces. Some of the villagers went back to collect Papuashvili’s body. Khekhelashvili
told Human Rights Watch, “When they brought the body back we saw that there was a bullet
wound to his forehead that had not been there when we left him—apparently a control
shot.”332

fdda434f,126,Part 3: Violations by Russian Forces,"3.6 Pillaging, Destruction, Violence, and Threats against Civilians",,"As described in Chapter 4, Ossetian militias would in some cases arrive in villages together
with Russian forces, and the latter at the very least provided cover for the burning and
looting of homes. While some civilians described the conduct of Russian ground forces as
disciplined, Human Rights Watch documented several cases in which Russian forces,
together with Ossetian militias, used or threatened violence against civilians or looted and
destroyed civilian property. Some of these cases are described in Chapter 4.2; several
additional cases are highlighted here because of the active and discernable role played by
Russian forces. Acts of pillage are prohibited under customary international law and violate
article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention relating to the protection of civilians in armed
conflict. Pillaging is a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime. The cases
involve villages in South Ossetia and in undisputed Georgian territory.
Ilia Chulukidze, 84, a resident of Kvemo Achabeti north of Tskhinvali, told Human Rights
Watch about how Russian forces, acting alone, beat him:
Around 6:30 a.m. on August 11 I was home alone when three Russian
soldiers burst into my house. They broke the door and one put a weapon in
my face; others ran upstairs looking for something. They broke all the doors
and turned everything upside down, asking for weapons and rifles. I did not
have any and could not give them any. Because of that they started beating
me.
They were beating me with the butts of their automatics, particularly on the
head. My entire head was swollen. One of them hit me on the chest so hard
that I fell down and I could hardly stand up again. They demanded guns. I’ve
never had one. I was beaten until I lost consciousness. Then two of them
picked me up and put me on a bed and poured some water on me to bring
me round. They could not find anything and left.333
Ossetian forces came later, looted and burned Chulukidze’s house, and took him to the
detention center in Tskhinvali (see Chapters 4.2 and 4.4).

On August 15, armed Ossetians together with Russian forces looted and torched the homes
of Marine Tetunashvili, 73, and her neighbor, Teimuraz Tetunashvili, 78. Teimuraz
Tetunashvili described how, at around noon that day, he heard gunshots:

They said, “Give us your cow and money.” I said, “Here is one cow, take it!”

Marine Tetunashvili was sleeping in a small cottage in the yard next to her main house when
she heard shooting from the street.336 She told Human Rights Watch,
Three Ossetians then entered the yard, armed, in camouflage fatigues. They
went into the house, and pointed their guns at me, asking, “Where is your
son? Get out or we will burn you alive!” I told them, “I am alone, everyone is
in Tbilisi, what do you want from me?!” And I was just begging them, “Don’t
kill me, take whatever you want, but don’t kill me!”

5ae8ee34,129,Part 3: Violations by Russian Forces,3.7 Russia’s Responsibility as Occupying Power,,"When Russian forces entered Georgia, including South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are de
jure parts of Georgia, they did so without the consent or agreement of Georgia. International
humanitarian law on occupation therefore applied to Russia as an occupying power as it
gained effective control over areas of Georgian territory (see above, Chapter 1.2). Tskhinvali
and the rest of South Ossetia must be considered under Russian control from August 10,
when Georgian forces officially retreated, through the present. Villages in Gori district fell
under Russian control as Russian forces moved through them on August 12. Gori city must
be considered under effective Russian control at least from August 12 or 13 until August 22,
when Russian troops pulled back further north toward South Ossetia.339 Russia’s occupation
of the area adjacent to South Ossetia ended when its forces withdrew to the South Ossetia
administrative border on October 10.340
Human Rights Watch documented one occasion when Russian forces intervened to help a
civilian who was the victim of a crime in progress, and two distinct occasions when Russian
forces temporarily set up roadblocks to prevent looting. Yet overall, Russian authorities did
not take measures to stop the widespread campaign of destruction and violence against
civilians in villages in South Ossetia (see below, Chapters 4.2 and 4.3) and in the buffer zone
in undisputed Georgian territory. They allowed these areas to become a virtual no-man’s
land where individuals were able to commit war crimes—to kill, loot, and burn homes—with
impunity. This deliberate violence against civilians started in the immediate aftermath of
Georgian forces’ withdrawal from South Ossetia and continued in waves in the weeks that
followed; concomitantly, Russian forces’ failure to ensure protection of civilians in territories
under their control was persistent. Russian forces therefore violated their obligation as an
occupying power to “ensure public order and safety” and to provide security to the civilian
population in the territory under its control. This is a serious violation of international
humanitarian law.341

e5c75111,130,Part 3: Violations by Russian Forces,3.7 Russia’s Responsibility as Occupying Power,In South Ossetia,"On August 13, following several media reports about the massive looting and burning in
ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia, Russian Minister of Internal Affairs Rashid
Nurgaliev stated that looting in South Ossetia “shall be decisively stopped.343 That day
Russian forces established checkpoints at both ends of a key road connecting the town of
Java to Tskhinvali, thus preventing access to five ethnic Georgian villages along that road. At
the checkpoint near the village of Kekhvi the commanding officer, a Russian lieutenant
colonel, told Human Rights Watch: “We’re now trying to stop the looters. They steal and set
fire to things … I see no end to this.”344
Human Rights Watch observed that the checkpoints significantly reduced the pillaging and
destruction in the villages and that Russian servicemen at the roadblocks approached their
duties conscientiously despite the evident and, at times, aggressive resentment of Ossetian
militias.345 About a week later, however, without any explanation, the checkpoints were

4.3. Russian authorities have not responded to Human Rights Watch’s request for
information about why the roadblocks were removed.
In an interview with the BBC in October, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov at
first denied and then attempted to explain away the destruction of ethnic Georgian villages:
“No, this is not ethnic cleansing. This was also the area of the war. When I say that the
Georgians were moving their artillery and tanks closer to Tskhinvali, this also included the
Georgian enclaves in South Ossetia, where they secretly organized strongholds.”346 The
correspondent stressed to Lavrov that Ossetian militias told the BBC directly that they were
burning civilian houses, and suggested that Russia should have “prevented that from
happening.”347 Lavrov notably did not respond to this point about Russia’s duty and capacity
to prevent the destruction. He acknowledged that the destruction was regrettable, but
offered a dismissive explanation: “Well, of course, when your city is attacked, when your
loved ones, when your relatives, when your children, when your parents, brothers and
sisters are being killed, brutally, you can go emotional and you can go really [emotional] in a
very unwanted way.”348
Several people told Human Rights Watch that Russian ground forces in general did not
attack local residents and in some cases tried to protect the civilian population from
Ossetian forces, militia members, or criminal elements.
For example, late in the evening on August 11, Gocha Demetrashvili, 44, drove to South
Ossetia to evacuate his parents. After he passed through Eredvi, two UAZ military vehicles
started following him. The vehicle’s occupants, whom Demetrashvili described as Ossetians
in camouflage, fired at his car, shooting out the two rear tires. Demetrashvili continued on,
hoping to get to the Russian military checkpoint in Dmenisi. As he approached Dmenisi, he
got out and began to run towards the Russian checkpoint, shouting, “I am a civilian. I need
help!” Several of the Ossetians got out of their cars and chased Demetrashvili. He described
to Human Rights Watch what happened next:
The Ossetians caught up to me and began beating me their fists and their
gun butts and kicking me.… They had me at gunpoint, and I thought they

wanted to shoot me. That’s when some of the Russian soldiers came up to us
and took me away from the Ossetians.
The Ossetians drove off with Demetrashvili’s car, and the Russian soldiers kept
Demetrashvili at their checkpoint for three nights, apparently reluctant to let him go for fear
that Ossetians might again attack him. On the third day, Russian troops escorted
Demetrashvili through the nearby Ossetian villages from where he walked on his own
approximately 30 kilometers back to Gori. 349 (It bears noting, however, that Russian forces
did not apprehend the assailants, and allowed them to drive off with Demetrashvili’s car.)"
78660394,132,Part 3: Violations by Russian Forces,3.7 Russia’s Responsibility as Occupying Power,In Gori District,"As Russian forces established control in portions of Gori district, they set up checkpoints in
the south of the district and strictly limited entry and exit from the south. While in most
cases Russian forces permitted civilians to pass through the checkpoints after checking
identification documents and inspecting vehicles for weapons, they refused access to
Georgian police, preventing them from maintaining law and order in these areas.
Two residents of Tkviavi, a village 12 kilometers south of Tskhinvali that was particularly
hard hit by looters from South Ossetia, told Human Rights Watch that the looting decreased
when the Russian forces maintained a checkpoint in the village, although the marauders
kept coming during the night.350
Several Tkviavi villagers told Human Rights Watch that they believed that more frequent
patrolling by the Russian forces or Georgian police would have improved security in the area.
One told Human Rights Watch that looters “seemed to be afraid to encounter the Russians,
and were hiding from them,” suggesting that had Russian forces taken more preventive
measures to stop violence against civilians these measures would have been effective.351

bc4d25fc,133,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,4.1 Overview,,"Human Rights Watch found that South Ossetian forces and militias committed serious
violations of international humanitarian law, including war crimes, in South Ossetia and
undisputed Georgian territory controlled by Russian forces.
South Ossetian forces and militias embarked on a campaign of deliberate and systematic
destruction of the Tbilisi-backed villages in South Ossetia, which involved the widespread
and systematic pillage and torching of houses, and beatings and threats against civilians. In
undisputed parts of Georgian territory they conducted a campaign of deliberate violence
against civilians, burning and looting their homes, and committing execution-style killings,
rape, abductions, and countless beatings. They rounded up at least 159 ethnic Georgians,
killing at least one and subjecting nearly all of them to inhuman and degrading treatment
and inhuman conditions of detention. They also tortured at least four Georgian prisoners of
war and executed at least three.
In engaging in the violence summarized above, South Ossetian forces and militias
egregiously violated multiple obligations under humanitarian law with respect to treatment
of protected persons, including civilians and others hors de combat. Murder, rape, acts of
torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, and wanton destruction of homes and property are
all strictly prohibited under both humanitarian law and human rights law, and the
perpetrators of such acts should be held criminally responsible for them. To the extent that
any of these prohibited acts was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack
directed against any civilian population, they may be prosecuted as a crime against
humanity. Where any of these acts, as well as acts such as imprisonment, unlawful
detention of civilians, pillaging, and comprehensive destruction of homes and property,
were carried out with discriminatory intent against a particular group, in this case ethnic
Georgians, they also constitute the crime of persecution, a crime against humanity,
prosecutable under the statute of the International Criminal Court.352

South Ossetian forces include South Ossetian Ministry of Defense and Emergencies
servicemen, riot police (known by the Russian acronym OMON), and several police
companies, working under the South Ossetian Ministry of Internal Affairs, and servicemen of
the South Ossetian State Committee for Security (KGB).353 Many interviewees told Human
Rights Watch that most able-bodied men in South Ossetia took up arms to protect their
homes.354 As South Ossetia has no regular army its residents tend to refer to the members of
South Ossetian forces as militias (opolchentsy) unless they can be distinctly identified as
policemen or servicemen of the Ministry of Defense and Emergencies. Credible sources also
spoke about numerous men from North Ossetia and several other parts of Russia who fought
in the conflict in support of South Ossetia and who were involved in the crimes against
civilians that followed.
In some cases, it is difficult to establish the exact identity and status of the Ossetian
perpetrators because witnesses’ common description of their clothing (camouflage uniform,
often with a white armband) could apply to South Ossetian Ministry of Defense and
Emergencies, South Ossetian Ministry of Internal affairs, volunteer fighters, or even common
criminal looters. Several factors, however, indicate that in many cases the perpetrators
belonged to South Ossetian forces operating in close cooperation with Russian forces. The
perpetrators often arrived in villages together with or shortly after Russian forces passed
through them; the perpetrators sometimes arrived on military vehicles; and the perpetrators
seem to have freely passed through checkpoints manned by Russian or South Ossetian
forces.
Witnesses sometimes also referred to the perpetrators as Chechens and Cossacks; whether
this was an accurate identification is not clear, although there were media reports of
Chechens and Cossacks participating in the conflict.355 In some cases, witnesses claimed
that the groups of perpetrators consisted of both Ossetians and Russians. These incidents

d94235dd,136,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,4.2 Attacks on Georgian Civilians and Their Villages in South Ossetia,Basic chronology,"As tensions mounted in the first week of August 2008, some inhabitants of ethnic Georgian
villages that had Tbilisi-backed administrations fled to undisputed Georgian territory.356
Most of the others fled on the first day of the hostilities. Ethnic Georgians who remained did
so either because they were infirm, because they wanted to protect their homes, or simply
because they could not bring themselves to leave their homes.
Beginning August 10, after Russian ground forces had begun to fully occupy South Ossetia
and were moving onward into undisputed Georgian territory, Ossetian forces followed
closely behind them and entered the ethnic Georgian villages. Upon entering these villages,
Ossetian forces immediately began going into houses, searching for Georgian military
personnel, looting property, and burning homes. They also physically attacked many of the
remaining residents of these villages, and detained dozens of them. Human Rights Watch
received uncorroborated reports of at least two extrajudicial killings of ethnic Georgians in
South Ossetia that took place amidst the pillaging. In most cases, Russian forces had moved
through the Georgian villages by the time South Ossetian forces arrived. In other cases,
Russian forces appeared to give cover to South Ossetian forces while they were committing
these offenses.
By August 11, the attacks intensified and became widespread.357 Looting and torching of
most of these villages continued intermittently through September, and in some through"

When Human Rights Watch visited Tamarasheni, Zemo Achabeti, Kvemo Achabeti, Kurta,
and Kekhvi in August, our researchers saw first-hand these villages being looted and torched.
When our researchers returned in September, the villages had been almost fully destroyed;
in Kekhvi the debris of some houses along the road appeared to have been bulldozed. Also
in September Human Rights Watch visited Eredvi, Vanati, Avnevi, and Nuli, which by that
time had been almost completely destroyed by burning. In November Human Rights Watch
visited Beloti, Satskheneti, Atsriskhevi, and Disevi, also almost fully destroyed.
Human Rights Watch researchers conducted a total of 57 interviews with people from the
villages mentioned above and from Dzartsemi, Kheiti, Prisi, and Kemerti; these 17 villages
account for most of the areas in South Ossetia that had been controlled by Tbilisi prior to the
war. Our researchers also interviewed members of Ossetian militias and the Russian military.
Human Rights Watch’s observations on the ground and from these interviews have led us to
conclude that the South Ossetian forces sought to ethnically cleanse these villages: that is,
the destruction of the homes in these villages was deliberate, systematic, and carried out on
the basis of the ethnic and imputed political affiliations of the residents of these villages,
with the express purpose of forcing those who remained to leave and ensuring that no
former residents would return.
International humanitarian law prohibits collective punishment,358 acts of reprisal against
civilians,359 pillage,360 and deliberate destruction of civilian property.361 Violations of these
prohibitions are grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention, or war crimes.
The interviews and ground observations by Human Rights Watch indicate that these villages
were looted and burned by Ossetian militias and common criminals. With a few exceptions
of looting and beatings of civilians, Russian forces did not participate directly in the
destruction of villages and attacks on civilians but, aside from a brief period in mid-August,
did not interfere to stop them (see Chapter 3.7, Russia’s Responsibility as Occupying Power).

with tanks who remained in the village.363 Ilia Chulukidze, an 84-year-old resident, told"
5e7a9c76,139,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,4.2 Attacks on Georgian Civilians and Their Villages in South Ossetia,Human Rights Watch that on August 11,"Russians and Ossetians and other irregulars … took carpets, televisions,
clothes, everything … The next day they took wine, vodka, jams, canned food,
two cows, and a calf. They were taking everything from everyone. The entire
village was looted and emptied.
After they took everything from my house, the Ossetians brought petrol. They
put me into a car and [made me] watch them … pour petrol everywhere in the
rooms and outside and then set the house on fire. I saw them torch my
neighbors’ houses. They did not even allow me to get some clothes out and
change. I was begging them for it, but in vain.364
Chulukidze also said that before this, Russian soldiers beat him (as described in Chapter
3.6).
Armed Ossetians entered the neighboring village, Kvemo Achabeti, on August 11, following
Russian tanks, and started looting immediately. Mamuka N., a 74-year-old villager, told
Human Rights Watch that several members of the militia came to his house on August 11,
and tried to steal some household items. When he protested, they set the house on fire and
left. When Human Rights Watch spoke to Mamuka N. he was trying to put out the fire, still
burning a day later; his hands were burned, his hair was singed, and he appeared to be in
shock. Mamuka N. told Human Rights Watch that the vast majority of local villagers,
including his family, had fled Kvemo Achabeti when active fighting broke out on August 8,
but he had decided to stay to look after the cattle. He said that roughly five to 10 elderly and
sick people remained in the village, all in a similarly desperate condition, and that many of

Another resident of Kvemo Achabeti, 80-year-old Rezo Babutsidze, told Human Rights Watch
that after the Russian tanks entered the village,
[they] were followed by Ossetians who were looting and then burning houses.
They came several times to my house, taking everything they liked. Once they
looted everything they liked they poured petrol and set the house on fire. I
watched how they burned my house and neighbors’ houses. They warned me

Another Kekhvi resident, 71-year-old Shermadin Nebieridze, told Human Rights Watch that
on August 11, five Ossetian men entered and looted his house, taking a cellphone, clothing,
and other items. He and other villagers fled to nearby Dzartsemi, where for several hours
they sought shelter from intense gunfire and shelling. Later in the evening Nebieridze could
see, from a hill in Dzartsemi overlooking Kekhvi, at least a dozen houses on fire in Kekhvi,
including his own. Nebieridze began to weep as he described to Human Rights Watch
returning to his burning home to try to save his cattle:
When I got to my house I saw that it was already half burned. The roof and
second floor were on fire; the bed, the windows, the door were already
destroyed. The house was still burning. I didn’t go in. I couldn’t stop it. There
was nothing I could do.369
Nebieridze saw Ossetian forces preparing to burn his neighbor’s house. The Ossetians
spotted Nebieridze, dragged him into the neighbor’s yard, and beat him before detaining
him, yelling, “Why are you here? … It’s not your house anymore. It’s ours. Why don’t you

Tamar Khutsinashvili, described the looting and burning of her family’s home:
Ossetians came to my house on August 10, three or four of them. They first
looted everything they could, including my car. They put hay in the house and
set it on fire and burned the house. We had to watch it but could not do
anything. They did not allow us to take anything from the house, not even our
identity documents. 371
Rusudan Chrelidze, 76, also described burning and looting in Tamarashani:
Several people from my neighborhood tried to flee together to Achabeti, but I
could not run fast enough. I heard shooting from that direction so I returned
to Tamarasheni in the evening. I saw that my house was burning. By the time
I got there it was almost completely burned. I also saw that my three
children’s houses were burning.
I went to my neighbor, who is missing a leg and so could not flee. Her house
was also burned, but she had a basement where she was hiding. We hid in
the basement together. We saw that our neighbor’s pigs had been
slaughtered and taken away. We saw that many things had been taken from
houses.372
Evidence of the burning of villages in Didi Liakhvi is also provided by images taken by a
commercial satellite on August 19 and analyzed by experts of the Geneva-based UNOSAT
program.373 UNOSAT experts identified visible structures on the images that were likely to

patterns of destruction that were consistent with the data gathered by Human Rights Watch.
UNOSAT provided a map that marked satellite-detected active fire locations in the ethnic
Georgian villages around Tskhinvali, including those described above.374 The map shows
active fires in the ethnic Georgian villages on August 10, 12, 13, 17, 19 and 22.375
UNOSAT also released a set of six high-resolution satellite images of Didi Liakhvi stretching
9 kilometers north from Tskhinvali, showing that the majority of villages along this stretch
were destroyed. The images strongly indicate that the majority of the destruction in five of
the villages—Tamarasheni, Kekhvi, Kvemo Achabeti, Zemo Achabeti, and Kurta—was caused
by intentional burning and not shelling or bombardment.376
The damage shown in the ethnic Georgian villages is massive and concentrated. By August
22, in Tamarasheni, UNOSAT’s experts counted a total of 177 buildings destroyed or severely
damaged,377 accounting for almost all of the buildings in the village. In Kvemo Achabeti they
counted 87 destroyed and 28 severely damaged buildings (115 total); in Zemo Achabeti, 56
destroyed and 21 severely damaged buildings (77 total); in Kurta, 123 destroyed and 21
severely damaged buildings (144 total); in Kekhvi, 109 destroyed and 44 severely damaged
buildings (153 total); in Kemerti, 58 destroyed and 20 severely damaged buildings (78 total);

Only along the main road through Tamarasheni are a number of homes visible with collapsed exterior walls, which may

bombardment. The exterior and interior masonry walls of most of the destroyed homes are still standing, but the wood-framed
roofs are collapsed, indicating that the buildings were burned.

houses and loading property onto two vehicles. Two of the looters were armed and wearing
fatigues.
In the neighboring village of Vanati on the same day Human Rights Watch found that
practically all the houses were burned (some were still burning), with the exception of those
that allegedly belonged to the few Ossetian villagers (houses that were intact had signs on
that identified their Ossetian ownership). There appeared to be no ethnic Georgians left in
the village."
05e42e6a,144,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,12.367 Two elderly women from Kekhvi wept as two days later they told Human Rights Watch,Disevi,"The torching of Disevi—an ethnic Georgian village of about 300 families that borders on
three ethnic Ossetian villages—appeared to start around August 11, after Ossetian and
Russian forces entered the village the previous day, and continued through October.379 Its
residents were gradually driven out by the torching and looting.
A 56-year-old woman who fled Disevi, Tamar Okhropiridze, told Human Rights Watch that
half of the houses in the village were burnt in one day soon after Russian and Ossetian
forces entered the village around August 10. She described in detail the torching of her own
home,
I was hiding in the backyard of my house. Six men entered my yard. One was
in civilian clothes; another was in military camouflage pants but a colorful
shirt. They put together a heap of furniture and other household items, linens,
and clothes. They poured something on it, probably kerosene, and set it on
fire. I saw them go to my neighbor’s house and set it on fire in the same way.
I thought I could save it. I tried to pour water on the bed that was on fire…380
On September 13 Human Rights Watch spoke by telephone with Ia Khetaguri, 50, who was
still living in a hillside neighborhood of Disevi despite the security challenges. Khetaguri
said that only about 30 villagers remained and that most of the village had been burned.381

September 13.383 Two days later Khetaguri had to flee the village as houses in her
neighborhood were also torched.384 Another Disevi resident, who was living in a facility for
the displaced but maintained telephone contact with relatives remaining in Disevi, also
reported that three houses were burning on September 15;385 it is not known whether these
accounts overlap.
When Human Rights Watch visited Disevi on November 24, the village appeared destroyed
and completely deserted.

village, on the Gori district side of the administrative border, to see his house, which had

to this place and looking at what used to be my and my children’s home. We
are all refugees now, we lost everything. And Disevi is like a desert. The very

leave, then another would come and then leave. They took whatever they
liked. Sometimes they would come into the yard and start shooting in the air.
Some were very aggressive and yelling. One time, one Ossetian came in and
had a huge knife and threatened to kill me. Another was more considerate …
But in any case they just took whatever they wanted.
Sometimes people in civilian clothes from neighboring Ossetian villages
would also come and loot. They took our seven cows, and one pig. We had 19
beehives—they were all taken and all the equipment for the beekeeping.
They also took … a television. Some houses were burned, but I begged them
in Ossetian not to burn ours. Our daughter’s house [also in Beloti] was
burned.388
When Human Rights Watch visited Beloti in November, the village appeared almost
completely destroyed by burning. One of the three remaining residents of Satskheneti,
another ethnic Georgian village close to Beloti, confirmed our assessment of Beloti as fully
deserted.389
In November Human Rights Watch also saw that most of the houses in Satskheneti had been
burned, with only a few still intact. Most residents had fled either right before or at the start
of the armed conflict. Vladimir K., 73, remained in his home because he “spent a whole life
building [it].” According to him, the looters, most of them armed and dressed in fatigues,
started robbing and burning homes around August 10. Militias looted Vladimir K.’s home
several times and set fire to it twice, but he had been able to put the fires out. When we
spoke to him he expressed fear that it was only a matter of time before his house would be
burned down; at this writing we do not know whether his fears have been realized.390
Atsriskhevi, a small, remote mountain village beyond Beloti, was fully deserted and almost
completely destroyed, with only two houses still intact when Human Rights Watch was there
in November.

Georgians and administered by Tbilisi, and the other populated mainly by ethnic Ossetians
and administered by Tskhinvali. Widescale looting and torching in the Tbilisi-administered
part began around August 12, and continued at a lesser scale at least until early September,
causing most villagers to flee; by November looters were hauling bricks and piping from the
remains of the houses.391
When Human Rights Watch visited Avnevi on September 4, its Tbilisi-administered part was
almost fully destroyed by fire and looting. A Human Rights Watch researcher also saw and
photographed two active fires in this part of the village.
Several days prior, militias burned the house of 86-year-old Elena Zoziashvili, who was then
forced to live in a shed in her yard, with nothing to eat except what was in her vegetable
patch. Zoziashvili is half blind and nearly deaf, and appeared to be in shock when Human
Rights Watch spoke to her.392 Several days later, the ICRC evacuated Zoziashvili to Tbilisi,
where she had relatives.

When we visited, several of the homes in the Tbilisi-administered part of Avnevi had been
looted but not burned, though militias threatened to torch them. The home of Vakhtang
Durglishvili, an elderly Georgian whose family had fled, was intact because, he thought, an
Ossetian acquaintance from the Ossetian part of the village took Durglishvili under his
protection, including by bringing him food on a regular basis.393
Nuli is the next village to Avnevi. A Human Rights Watch researcher who walked through Nuli
on September 4, 2008, saw that most of its houses had been burned and found the village
deserted.

check on Chovelidze, and found him and his wife at home in Kemo Achabeti on August 13,
amid scenes of ongoing destruction in the village:395
When I saw Omar on the 13th in the middle of that burning village I could
hardly believe it! I said, “Are you crazy? You must get out of here! Let me take
you to Georgia.” But he refused flatly. He said he had a Russian passport and
that’d protect him from the militias. When I returned three days later I found
his body and that of his wife in the yard. [The house had been burned down.]
I felt so awful I jumped in the car and drove away. But I did come back the
next day to bury their bodies. I made a grave for them right in the yard and
put a wooden cross on it.396
Tamar Okhropiridze, whose description of the burning of Disevi is given above, said that she
witnessed Ossetian militias burn the house of 70-year-old Elguja Okhropiridze and shoot
him dead. She also claimed to have seen an old woman burned to death in Disevi:
On the second day [of looting and burning]… Nato Okhropiridze, age 70, was
burned in her house. I saw that Nato’s house was on fire and I went to her
house. When I arrived I saw that something had fallen on her and burned her.
She had a bucket in her hand, as if she was trying to put out the fire in her
house.397"

On August 11 Ossetian militias began looting and burning homes in Zonkar, a tiny Tskhinvali-
administered hamlet in the Patara Liakhvi valley surrounded by ethnic Georgian villages.398
Human Rights Watch spoke to the only two remaining villagers, ethnic Ossetians Aza Valieva
and her distant cousin Tamaz Valiev. Ossetian forces targeted them repeatedly because they
believed either that the Valievs were ethnic Georgians or were collaborating with the
Georgian authorities. At one point the attackers included men dressed in uniforms with
insignia worn by Ossetian peacekeepers.
The attackers stole 8,000 roubles, a television, a VCR, three chainsaws, cattle, and other
valuables from Tamaz Valiev.399 They looted Aza Valieva’s house, including taking 28,000
roubles.400 Both Valievs said they repeatedly explained to the looters and militias that they
were Ossetian and even showed their passports. The perpetrators, however, ignored their
pleas or said that because they lived in this village in the middle of a Georgian enclave, they
must either be Georgian or have had something to do with the Georgians.
Aza Valieva said that men dressed in Ossetian peacekeeper uniforms tried to set fire to her
house. Although she reported the incident to the police, no officials from the South Ossetia
prosecutor’s office came to her house to investigate. She told Human Rights Watch,
On August 23 several servicemen came in a Kamaz-truck and not only took
some things from my house but actually tried to burn it. They were Ossetian
peacekeepers. This I know for sure because they had those two letters, MS
[the Russian acronym for Mirotvorscheskie Sily, or Peackeeping Forces] on
their uniforms. They were shooting at the windows, saying obscene things.
One of them aimed his sub-machine gun at me and yelled, “You just know
how to speak Ossetian but in reality you’re Georgian! Get the hell out of
here!” Finally, they threw some blankets and clothes on the floor and set
them on fire. I managed to [put out the fire] and then ran for the police. I
showed them everything, explained the situation, and even told them the
license plate number of the truck. They said I should not touch anything in
the room because there would be an investigation but it’s been three months
and no one has done anything.401
398
After the 1992 conflict, only three families—two Ossetian and one ethnically mixed—remained in Zonkar. When the looting
started in August 2008 the ethnically mixed family fled to undisputed Georgia.

to Human Rights Watch about the burning and looting and expressed fear for their own
security and the safety of their home. According to them, the looters had already stolen
everything valuable they could find in the Georgian households and had begun to harass the
remaining Ossetian residents. They expressed their frustration with the authorities for failing
to provide security.402
Most residents of Beloti (see above), which had about 50 families, were ethnic Georgians
but some were Ossetian, mainly women married to Georgians.403 Militias and common
criminals looted and burned Georgian and mixed households alike.
In the Froni valley village of Avneni Human Rights Watch found mixed-marriage households
similarly at the mercy of looters. The house of one elderly couple, Zalina Bestaeva and
Durmishkhan Sikturashvili, remained intact but had been looted. Bestaeva and Sikturashvili
were afraid that their house would be torched in the near future. “They [armed looters]
almost set fire to the house!” said Bestaeva to Human Rights Watch. “We were kissing their
hands, anything, as long as they left us in peace. But they keep coming back and take first
one thing, then another. Our neighbor lost all her money to them, down to the last penny.”404

Bestaeva’s neighbor is Anna Kokoeva, an Ossetian married to an ethnic Georgian. Kokoeva’s
husband fled at the start of the fighting but she stayed behind to watch over their house.
She was able to convince the looters not to burn the house but they robbed her of money
and valuables several days prior to Human Rights Watch’s visit on September 8. Kokoeva
told Human Rights Watch,
I had been saving for a year to pay for crowns on my teeth and saved up
1,500 roubles [approximately US$60], but then the looters, the militias, came
and they took it all! I was pleading with them but they yelled at me and even
threatened to burn down my house. They were saying that my husband was a"

house. Nothing is left. I keep telling them I’m Ossetian and so is my husband,
but what do they care? They’ve appropriated everything of any value that
belonged to Georgians and now they’re after our property. And if you try to
argue with them, they threaten to burn your house. They know they can do
what they want in this village and no one will ever punish them!407
Elizaveta Dzhioeva described to Human Rights Watch that the looters were “completely
ruthless” and her own and her husband’s Ossetian ethnicity did not protect them from
looting:
I’m scared to go to the city [to buy food] because the looters are likely to burn
my home if I leave even for a few hours. They’ve already burnt my daughter’s
house [also in this part of the village]. They come every day and they really
don’t care if you are an Ossetian. I was once away from the house for a short
while and they literally stole everything that we had there! When the burning
started some Ossetian fighters were telling me not to worry. They were saying
that we wouldn’t be touched or suffer in any way because we were Ossetian.
How wrong they were! The looters don’t give a damn who you are, as long as
you live here!408"

the rest of the territory.409 There were no hostilities there during the August conflict, but
following the conflict Russian forces occupied the district, prompting the dismissal of the
Tbilisi-backed administration. This facilitated the appointment, by Tskhinvali, of an Ossetian

After the end of fighting in August, Russian authorities began constructing a road from Tskhinvali to Akhalgori through the
mountains. However, at this writing the construction has not been completed and traveling to and from the South Ossetian

administration for the district on September 3, 2008.410 At this writing, the Russian military
presence in Akhalgori is substantial, with two bases in the district.411 However, according to
the head of Akhalgori’s district administration and local residents, Russian servicemen
mainly keep to their bases. The Ossetian police, including OMON and KGB personnel, are
deployed to the region from Tskhinvali on a rotating basis.412
In contrast to the villages in the Didi Liakhvi, Patara Liakhvi, and Froni valleys, villages in
Akhalgori district have not been burned by Ossetian militias. However, its ethnic Georgian
residents are threatened and harassed by militias, and frightened by the possible closure of
the district’s administrative border with the rest of Georgia. The harassment and anxiety
have caused great numbers of people to leave for undisputed Georgian territory.413
Nuzgar N., age 48, an ethnic Georgian resident of Akhalgori town, summarized these
anxieties and their consequences:
Thousands of people used to live here before August and now this place is
like a desert. And how else can it be? There are all those armed people who
frighten the locals by their mere presence.
Residents who could leave have mostly left. Families with young girls were
afraid their daughters would be harassed by Ossetians. And the parents were
no less concerned for the boys. They can easily be harassed. As a result, it’s
mostly elderly people that stayed, or those who have no place to go. I stayed

According to the head of the new administration, Anatoly Margiev, a decree appointing the new administration was signed
by President Kokoity on September 3, 2008. By the end of November 2008, no village administrations have been appointed.
The new district administration seems to enjoy no authority in Akhalgori, and Margiev acknowledged having no capacity to
fulfill its administrative functions. Human Rights Watch interview with Anatoly Margiev, Akhalgori town, November 20, 2008.

Human Rights Watch cannot confirm the exact number of the remaining residents. The newly appointed Ossetian
administration told Human Rights Watch that 8,836 people out of the pre-August population of approximately 13,000 remain
in Akhalgori district, although according to Georgian government data the pre-war population was 7,894 and as of October 7,
2009, 3,597 people had been displaced and were staying in camps for displaced persons in Gori. See Government of Georgia,

approximately 200 families before the August conflict and only about 20 families remained as of November 21, 2008. Human
Rights Watch interview with Giorgi X. corroborated by a dozen local residents, Kvanchavetti, November 21, 2008. Though the
exodus from the smaller villages appears more dramatic than from the regional center, Akhalgori town itself also looked
largely abandoned by its residents."

9b09ca61,155,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,12.367 Two elderly women from Kekhvi wept as two days later they told Human Rights Watch,Ossetian militia violence and intimidation,"At least two people were beaten by Ossetian militias in separate incidents in Akhalgori
district in November 2008, causing the death of one and severe injury to the other.
Akhalgori town hospital staff told Human Rights Watch that around November 5 they treated
Kanchaveti resident Givi Tetunashvili, age 76. Tetunashvili was brought to the hospital
bleeding, with multiple bruises, a fractured arm and severe injury to his genitals.
Tetunashvili told the doctors that he had been watching over his grazing sheep when several
armed men in camouflage uniforms tried to steal one of them. When he protested, they
started beating him.415 Tetunashvili was in critical condition and was transferred for further
treatment to Tbilisi, where he died approximately two weeks later.
When Human Rights Watch researchers visited Kanchaveti on November 21, they happened
upon a crowd of local residents going to Tetunashvili’s wake. Tetunashvili’s wife, Rusiko,
who was among the crowd, told Human Rights Watch that she was with her husband on the
day he was assaulted and witnessed the incident. The assailants also threatened her, but
did not beat her. She recognized one assailant as a member of the Ossetian militia and a
resident of a neighboring Ossetian village.416
As Human Rights Watch was talking to Tetunashvili’s relatives and neighbors, aggressive
and apparently intoxicated armed militia members arrived in a military truck and chased the
crowd away, preventing them from talking to Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch and
Human Rights Centre Memorial reported Tetunashvili’s case to the authorities in Tskhinvali.
In December 2008 a leading Russian human rights activist, Svetlana Gannushkina of
Memorial and the Civic Assistance Committee, told Human Rights Watch that on December
19, during her visit to Tskhinvali, she was informed by the deputy prosecutor of South
Ossetia that “three perpetrators are held in custody” facing trial for “infliction of severe
bodily harm” to Tetunashvili.417 At this writing, the trial has not taken place.

Akhalgori town hospital staff also told Human Rights Watch that on November 16 they
treated an 83-year-old resident of Korinta, Nestor Tinikashvili, who was severely bruised and
had a fractured arm. The doctor said Tinikashvili told him that four Ossetians in camouflage
uniforms had beaten him up because he had a photograph of Mikheil Saakashvili on his
wall and admitted to them that he considered Saakashvili to be his president.418
Three members of the Ossetian police interviewed by Human Rights Watch in Akhalgori town
confirmed the details of this incident and said that one of the perpetrators had been
apprehended and transferred to the police in Tskhinvali. Human Rights Watch has not been
able to confirm whether the suspect remains in custody and whether the de facto South
Ossetian authorities conducted a criminal investigation.419"
5e6771b9,156,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,12.367 Two elderly women from Kekhvi wept as two days later they told Human Rights Watch,Anxiety about border closure,"At this writing Akhalgori’s administrative border with the rest of Georgia border is open,
though residents must pass through Russian-Ossetian checkpoints, where their
identification documents are thoroughly checked and vehicles searched.
The new head of the Akhalgori district administration, Anatoly Margiev, told Human Rights
Watch that the border was not likely to close, though not all of his staff shared this view.420
Margiev also told Human Rights Watch that as of January 2009 the administration would
start processing South Ossetian passports for all residents of Akhalgori, “in order to be able
to move freely in North and South Ossetia. Following that, they will be also given Russian
citizenship.” Margiev tried to reassure Human Rights Watch that the residents would be
permitted to keep their Georgian passports. However, Russian citizenship law does not
provide for dual citizenship, and it remains unclear how those promises could be fulfilled in
practice, and whether Russian authorities in South Ossetia will respect Georgian passports
as valid for travel or other purposes.
The administration has not succeeded in reassuring Akhalgori residents, including their own
employees, for whom the prospect of an imminent closure of Akhalgori’s administrative
border is a source of tremendous anxiety. Natela N., an ethnic Georgian staff-member of the

able to see her first grandchild, who was due in December: “My three daughters all live in
Tbilisi. How in the world am I going to see them? I already know [the baby] is going to be a
girl. But will I ever see her?”421 Several civil servants (who were still receiving salaries from
Tbilisi) and other ethnic Georgian residents interviewed by Human Rights Watch all

have no choice but to leave.
Position of de facto South Ossetian Officials toward Looting and House"
5a069da9,157,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,12.367 Two elderly women from Kekhvi wept as two days later they told Human Rights Watch,Burning,"The de facto South Ossetian authorities were unrepentant about the destruction of ethnic
Georgian villages and took no effective steps to prevent their destruction, protect civilians,
and hold perpetrators accountable. On August 13, Anatoly Barankevich, then-head of the
Security Council for South Ossetia, told a correspondent of the Russian official daily
Rossiiskaya Gazeta that looting was indeed an issue, but largely dismissed it,
“Unfortunately, war is war.”422
Eduard Kokoity, de facto president of South Ossetia, was straightforward about the purpose
of the destruction in the villages. On August 15, in response to a question by Kommersant
Daily, an independent Russian newspaper, about the situation in the “Georgian enclaves” in
South Ossetia, Kokoity replied, “We practically have flattened everything there.” When
Kommersant inquired whether the villages in those areas were fully destroyed, Kokoity
confirmed this, asking, “So, you mean we should have allowed them [Georgians] to keep
shooting at us and make fools of us?” 423
According to Barankevich, the de facto South Ossetian authorities created a special
committee to combat looting in the republic and armed patrols to prevent looting in the
evening and at night. 424 These patrols did not operate effectively, if at all. Moreover, as
observed by Human Rights Watch, widespread looting and torching visibly took place during
daylight hours. The few remaining residents of ethnic Georgian villages whom Human Rights

Watch interviewed in situ also complained that the looters were pervasive and acted freely
during daylight hours. Additionally, in August and September Human Rights Watch
researchers saw numerous houses freshly set on fire in Tbilisi-backed villages, which
testifies to the fact that the torching of houses was also occurring during the day.
In September 2008 the head of the South Ossetia Committee for Press and Information, Irina
Gagloeva, told the Human Rights Centre Memorial in response to a question about the
situation in ethnic Georgian villages, “The looters aren’t really punished. If they’re caught by
police at all this is processed as an administrative infraction. So, they need to pay a 2,500
rouble fine [approximately US$100], and off they go. And for someone who stole five cows
paying this fine is not a big deal.” Gagloeva expressed hope that local police would resume
regular work in the near future and learn to do work diligently. She attempted to justify the
abuses in the ethnic Georgian villages by stressing that they cooperated with Tbilisi and with
the Georgian military and therefore—in contrast to those villages where ethnic Georgians
lived that were under Ossetian administration and remained intact—they “received exactly
what they’ve been preparing for 18 years [of the Georgia-Ossetia conflict].”425"

In mid-August 2008 Kokoity said that Ossetian authorities did not intend to let the Georgians
return to the destroyed villages.426 By the end of August 2008, he changed his position and
assured the UN High Commissioner for Refugees that the displaced Georgians willing to
return to South Ossetia would face no discrimination and have their security fully
guaranteed.427 In his September 2008 report, the human rights commissioner of the Council
of Europe, Thomas Hammerberg, “notes that the de facto Ossetian authorities expressed to

where (in an exception that was in apparent contradiction to Gagloeva’s assertion) the local Georgian school was burned by
alleged militias on September 1, the first day of classes after the summer break. Though classes are still held in two small
houses next to the school, the number of pupils had decreased from 50 to 15 by November. Human Rights Watch interview

the hostilities.”428
A key step to implementing this commitment would be to create security conditions that
would make ethnic Georgians feel safe upon return. But as noted above, no effective
measures were taken to stop the looting. Moreover, neither Ossetian nor Russian authorities
have taken concrete measures to hold accountable those who intentionally destroyed the
Georgian villages in the republic. Finally, Human Rights Watch is not aware of any steps
taken by the Ossetian authorities to enable the displaced to return.

documented six deliberate killings in undisputed Georgian territory controlled by Russian
forces, and received credible allegations of another six cases. As described above, Human

Human Rights Watch documented the execution of one Georgian detainee and three
Georgian prisoners of war by Ossetian forces, as described in Chapters 4.4 and 4.5.

tractor, sprayed the house with bullets, and then attempted to burn the house by setting fire
to some books on the balcony. Gulnara Melitauri told Human Rights Watch,
When I saw them leaving with the tractor, I ran into the bathroom to get water
in a bucket to put out the fire. With that, I saved the house. [Then] I went out
to find my husband. I found him and his brother lying next to each other.
There was blood everywhere. They had been shot. They both had huge awful
bruises on their faces.
Later that day a neighbor came and helped me move the bodies into the
house, but then he left the village. I could not bury the bodies myself and
there was no one there to help me. I had some apple vinegar, and I soaked
cloths in vinegar and put them on the bodies to try to preserve them. For five
days and nights, I was alone in the house. I sat with the bodies because I
feared that dogs and cats would try to eat them.431
Melitauri eventually approached Russian peacekeepers stationed in the village who helped
her bury the bodies in the backyard.
Another Tkviavi resident, Givi Chikhladze, age 62, witnessed the murder of his brother, Gela,
by Ossetian militias on August 12. That evening, Givi Chikhladze and his 82-year-old father-
in-law fled to Gela’s house after six armed Ossetians had stolen Givi’s tractor at gunpoint.
Shortly after arriving at Gela’s house, however, another group of Ossetians started banging
on the gate and shooting in the air. Givi Chikhladze told Human Rights Watch,
They broke into the yard, they shot through the lock. My brother went to ask
them to not burn down the house … And then I heard them shoot and they
shot him.
Two armed Ossetians took Givi Chikhladze and his father-in-law to a pigsty in the backyard,
made them lie down, and held them at gunpoint:
One pointed a machine gun at me and the other pointed a machine gun at
my father-in-law. For 40 minutes they held us like that. They themselves were

finish this off!” I was so terrified. I was crying.
When the two Ossetians went into the house, Givi crawled through the bushes after them to
see what was going on.
The Ossetians were still inside. I could hear my brother coughing, gasping for
air. It was a horrible sound. The sound of death.
Chikhladze remained hidden until around 10 p.m. When he emerged, he “smelled something
horrible” near his house, but did not return. He later learned that neighbors had found his
brother burned on the floor, apparently set on fire by the looters. Some women who were
neighbors buried him.432
Chikhladze and another villager named another six people—Nodar Batauri, Koba Jashiashvili,
Shamil Orkopiridze, Lasha Basharauli, Soso Otiashvili, and Jaba Jabaladze—who were killed

My father and I were harvesting crops in my grandmother’s field. As I
approached the house, two Ossetians in camouflage, armed with machine
guns, stopped me and asked me who I was. One of them cocked his gun and
demanded that I give him my cellphone, so I did.
The next evening, after going into the village, I returned to my grandmother’s
house and found that my father was being held by four armed men in masks,
wearing camouflage uniforms. They tried to take me and my father away. My
grandmother was protesting and pulling on my father to keep him from being
taken. One of them grabbed her to pull her away, and we all began to
struggle. The assailants shot me twice in the right leg. They shot my father …

Rape
Human Rights Watch received numerous reports of rape of ethnic Georgian women during
the August 2008 war. The Fourth Geneva Convention obliges parties to a conflict to protect
women from “attacks on their honour, especially rape,437 and rape is considered an act of
“willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health” that is a grave breach of
the Geneva Conventions, and a war crime. 438
Due to the sensitive nature of the crime, rape is frequently under-reported, and it is
particularly difficult to document cases during conflict. Human Rights Watch was able to
document two cases of rape in undisputed areas of Georgia under Russian control. Several
factors suggest that the perpetrators were members of South Ossetian forces or militia. In
both cases, the perpetrators wore military uniforms and white armbands, usually worn by
South Ossetian forces to identify them to the Russian army as friendly forces. In both cases,
the perpetrators spoke Ossetian. In one case, the perpetrators handed the victim over to the
South Ossetian police in Tskhinvali, who later included her with other detainees in a
prisoner exchange with Georgian authorities.
On August 13, Mariam C., in her 20s, left Tbilisi on a minibus with about 15 other passengers.
Near Gori city, around 1:30 p.m., the minibus had to turn back because the road was blocked
by Russian military troops.
As the driver turned the minibus around, four armed men in a black jeep drove up to it and
started shooting in the air, forcing the minibus to stop. The armed men, dressed in black T-
shirts, camouflage pants, and white armbands, ordered all the passengers out of the
minibus and confiscated their cellphones. They took the minibus and then let all of the
passengers go, except Mariam C. She described to Human Rights Watch the terror she felt
during the abduction,

As one of the assailants took my cellphone he looked me in the eye, and I
immediately felt that something terrible was going to happen. I just saw it in
his eyes. Everyone was released but me. I begged them to let me go, but
instead they dragged me and stuffed me into the jeep.
One of the assailants drove in the jeep with Mariam C., and three others rode in the minivan
in the direction of Tskhinvali. Before reaching Tskhinvali the driver stopped the car, telling
Mariam C. that it had broken down. They got out of the car on the edge of a deserted field
and the driver asked Mariam C. whether she was married and had children. She told Human"

to do it, not to touch me. He just forced me onto the ground, slapped me
several times, and raped me. The other three did the same.
At some point I must have lost consciousness. I saw them all before I fainted.
I was thinking that they would kill me afterwards because I saw their faces.
All I was thinking about—and waiting for—was when they would kill me.
When she regained consciousness she was surrounded by four or five men in military
camouflage uniforms—apparently servicemen—and three of her attackers. They placed her
in a Niva jeep and drove her to Tskhinvali. Mariam C. remembered feeling ill and in pain after
her attack. “I felt sick. I had a terrible headache, and my back was aching,” she told Human"

man in green military uniform gave her some medicine, including what she thought was a
tranquilizer. Around 5 p.m. Mariam C.’s captors brought her to the Tskhinvali police station
where she was interrogated. She told them what had happened to her. According to Mariam
C., the police officers did not write down the information but confiscated her gold ring,
earrings, and money, which they never returned. The police officers then took her to the
basement where she was put in a cell with 13 other women.439 (For a description of the

young woman’s condition when she arrived at the police station:
At one point they brought in a young girl. Her name was [Mariam C.]. When
they brought her in she immediately kneeled down on the floor and started
crying. I said, “What happened to you my daughter?” She said, ”I was taken
away by some men.” I asked, “Did they treat you badly?” And she said, “Yes,
very much so,” and continued to cry.440
On August 19 an unknown man arrived at the police station and promised to take Mariam C.
home. Instead, however, he took her to an apartment where a woman was living with her two
daughters. They gave her a separate room and meals, and treated her well. On August 22
Mariam C. was handed over to Georgian authorities during an exchange of prisoners, and
she sought and received medical care. She described to Human Rights Watch the trauma
she continued to suffer as a result of the rape: “Once back in Tbilisi, I was in shock and I
could not sleep for three nights. I now take strong tranquilizers to sleep. I have nightmares
and frequent headaches.”441
On the morning of August 13, 18-year-old Eliso E. and her family learned that Ossetian
looters were entering nearby villages (an uncle had phoned to say that looters had just
stolen his car and had shot his friend who had refused to hand over a truck). The family
began packing to leave their Gori district village,442 but as they were doing so seven men in
camouflage uniforms with white armbands arrived at their house in a Willys jeep. According
to Eliso E., the men were heavily armed with automatic weapons, grenades, and large knives.
The armed men forced Eliso E. and her mother to the second floor of the house at gunpoint.
They searched through the family’s clothes, apparently looking for military uniforms. Some
of the men beat Eliso E. on the shoulder and back with the butts of their guns and one
slapped her in the face. The intruders stole several items of electronic equipment as well as
gold jewelry and money (in the interests of protecting this young woman’s identity, the
details she gave have not been included with other accounts of looting featured below).

The armed men then took her mother downstairs and forced Eliso E. to stay in her room, with
one armed man guarding the door. She told Human Rights Watch,
I started crying and praying. I was very scared. Then one man came back to
my room. He was the one person who knew Russian, Ossetian, and Georgian.
He asked me, “Where is your husband?” I said that I don’t have one. He
ordered me to take off my clothes. I resisted, but I couldn’t stop him. He tore
my clothes off of me. He told me in Georgian, “You’d better do it yourself or
we will kill you and we’ll still do what we want with you.”
He asked me if I was a virgin and I said yes. He was the only one of them who
had a mask on his face. He started to really struggle with me, and I pulled the
mask off and I saw his face. This infuriated him and he started beating me.
Then he raped me and told me that if I told anyone, he would kill me.
Before they left, the armed men beat Eliso E.’s brother and cousin on the head, shoulder,
and back. She and her family left for Tbilisi. One month after the rape, Eliso E. told Human
Rights Watch that she continued to suffer from her attack. “One month has passed. I have
headaches, fever. I have terrifying nightmares, thinking that they are coming up the steps to
take me,” she said. “I don’t want to go back to that place where I lived before.”
Eliso did not immediately report the rape to a doctor, fearing the stigma attached to it, but
eventually sought medical assistance.443"

reports of Georgians who were abducted by Ossetians and not handed over to the police.
Abductions violate the ban, contained in article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, on
unlawful confinement of a protected person and are considered grave breaches, or war
crimes.

We were walking back to our home in [South Ossetia]. Two men in a Zhiguli
[car] … in camouflage uniforms with white armbands pulled up next to us.
One of them was Ossetian … They were armed with automatic weapons and a
big knife. The men didn’t get out of the car. They grabbed Natia by her hair
and dragged her into the car into the front seat. I begged them not to kill her.
I screamed, “Help me they are taking my child away!” … They drove off in the
direction of Tskhinvali.444
Soon after this interview, having had no information on her granddaughter’s fate for four
weeks, Lia B. learned that her granddaughter had been released from her captors sometime
in September. Natia B. told her grandmother that she had been kept alone in a run-down
deserted building and given bread and water daily, but did not report other abuse. She had
no idea where this building was located.445
Zura Kareli told Human Rights Watch that he was in Karaleti on August 19 or 20 on his way
home to Tkviavi together with his wife, son, and another relative. An Ossetian man wearing
camouflage and with an automatic weapon attempted to detain him, his family, and 10-12
residents of Karaleti. After some of the Karaleti villagers fled, the Ossetian man shot Kareli in
the hand in order to take the keys to Kareli’s car, and then drove off in the car with four
villagers in the back seat. Kareli did not know the names of those abducted and has no

to Human Rights Watch seeing militias shoot “a sort of rocket” into some of the houses,
which would set them on fire: “They were shooting at houses from a long weapon and
immediately after, the house would catch fire. It was Ossetians, not Russians, who set
houses on fire.”455

militias. Naskidashvili was not at home when the militias set fire to her house, but she

4.4. Execution, Illegal Detentions, Ill-Treatment, and Degrading Conditions
of Detention by Ossetian Forces, at times with Russian Forces
As Russian forces began to occupy South Ossetia on August 8 and 9, South Ossetian forces
traveled with them or followed them into ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and then
into Gori and Kareli districts. Most of the able bodied and younger residents had fled just
before the start of hostilities or in the initial days of fighting. Most of the residents who
remained in the villages had chosen to stay behind to look after their homes and property or
were unable to flee. Ossetian forces, at times together with Russian forces, detained some of
the residents they found remaining in these villages, particularly in the ethnic Georgian
villages of South Ossetia; in most cases, detentions took place in the context of the
campaign of looting and destruction described above. Detainees told Human Rights Watch
that they were not given reasons for their detention and did not have access to lawyers or
any opportunity to challenge their detention.
As Russian and Ossetian forces entered Georgian villages in South Ossetia and the Gori
district, they detained at least 159 people,467 primarily ethnic Georgians as well as at least
one Ossetian and one ethnic Russian married to an ethnic Georgian. Forty-five of the
detained were women. At least 76 were age 60 or older, and at least 17 were age 80 or
older.468 There was one child, a boy, about eight years old.469 Human Rights Watch
interviewed 29 of the detained, all post-release. Many detainees described ill-treatment
during detention, during transfer to custody, and in custody. Most detainees were held in the
basement of the South Ossetian Ministry of Interior building in Tskhinvali for approximately
two weeks in conditions that amounted to degrading treatment. Some of these detainees
were forced to work clearing the Tskhinvali streets of decomposing bodies of Georgian
soldiers, and debris. At least one man was executed while in Ossetian custody during his
transfer to the Ministry of Interior. All of these actions are grave breaches of the Geneva
Conventions and amount to war crimes. To the extent that Russia exercised effective control
in the territory where these detentions took place, the Russian government is liable for these
acts, which also amount to violations of its human rights obligations under the ICCPR and
the ECHR.

introduced themselves as members of Russian forces. Russian and Ossetian forces also held
at least six Georgians at what appeared to be a military field base and beat them before
handing them over to Ossetian police.
Legal Status of and Protections for Individuals Detained by Ossetian and"
c8c2e385,177,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,4.3 South Ossetian Abuses in Undisputed Georgian Territory,Russian Forces,"All of those detained by Ossetian and Russian forces and interviewed by Human Rights
Watch stated that they were civilians not participating in the hostilities and had not taken up
arms against Ossetian and Russian forces. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, which
defines the protections afforded to civilians during wartime, civilians are considered to be
protected persons. The Convention requires that persons “taking no active part in the
hostilities, … shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction
founded on race, color, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.”470
Grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention, including willful killing, torture and
inhuman treatment, and willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health,
are war crimes.471
The protections guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and
the European Convention on Human Rights are also applicable with respect to Ossetian and
Russian detention of Georgians. Since Russia at the time had effective control over the areas
where the detentions described in this section took place, it is Russia as the state party to
both instruments that bears responsibility for protecting individuals’ rights under the
convention. The ICCPR and ECHR provide an absolute prohibition on torture and other
degrading or inhuman treatment.472 The provisions of the ICCPR and ECHR banning arbitrary
detention are also applicable, and Russia did not derogate from those convention
obligations, although limited derogations in times of war are permitted.473

171 Human Rights Watch January 2009
During hostilities and occupation, the Fourth Geneva Convention permits the internment or
assigned residence of protected persons such as civilians for “imperative reasons of
security.”474 However, unlawful confinement of a protected person is a war crime.475
Human Rights Watch has not been presented with evidence that there were reasonable
security grounds for the detention of the 159 persons detained by Ossetian and Russian
forces. Many of those detained were very elderly, and one was a small child. Most were
detained in circumstances that strongly suggest that they were not taking up arms, not
participating in hostilities, and not otherwise posing a security threat, as described below.
If, among the detained, there were Georgians who participated in hostilities against
Ossetian or Russian forces, but who were not members of the Georgian military, under
international humanitarian law such persons would be considered non-privileged
combatants.476 Georgians who took up arms to defend their lives or property from advancing
Ossetian or Russian forces would be considered armed civilians. In both cases, detention of
such persons would be considered reasonable on security grounds. Such persons are
entitled to the protections guaranteed to civilians under the Fourth Geneva Convention.
Detentions must be carried out in accordance with a regular procedure permissible under
international humanitarian law. Those detained have a right to appeal their internment and
have their case reviewed every six months. The Fourth Geneva Convention provides detailed
regulations for the humane treatment of internees. The International Committee of the Red
Cross must be given access to all protected persons, wherever they are, whether or not they
are deprived of their liberty.477
Given their particular vulnerability, children are afforded special protections under the
Geneva Conventions. Protocol I states, “Children shall be the object of special respect …
Parties to the conflict shall provide them with the care and aid they require, whether
because of their age or for any other reason.”478
Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity has stated that “ethnic Georgians were detained for their
personal safety” and that “the Ministry of Interior [was] protecting them and saving their

security of civilians, Human Rights Watch has not found evidence that the detentions by
Russians and Ossetians had this purpose or were justified on these grounds. The fact that
the majority of individuals were detained as Georgian soldiers were retreating and in areas
in which Russian and Ossetians exercised effective control suggests that in most cases
civilians were not likely to be threatened by armed combat. Furthermore, Russian and
Ossetian forces apprehended most individuals in a violent and threatening manner and
subjected them to inhuman and degrading treatment and conditions of detention, and
forced labor, reflecting no intent on the part of these forces to provide for the personal safety
and well-being of those detained.

Gori district who reported ill-treatment, including beatings, humiliation, threats of killing,
and mock executions when Ossetians detained them. Some also reported ill-treatment
during transfer to the Ministry of Interior in Tskhinvali. Human Rights Watch documented the
execution of one man during his transfer to the Ministry of Interior. Willful killing and ill-
treatment of protected persons constitute war crimes.480"

neighboring village and then returned to his home in Kekhvi that evening, where his house
was burning (as described in Chapter 4.2). The next day, August 12, he was in his yard when
Ossetian forces armed with automatic weapons and wearing camouflage uniforms with
white armbands spotted him and forced him into a neighbor’s yard at gunpoint. Nebieridze
described to Human Rights Watch his treatment as the men detained him:
One of them loaded his weapon and pointed it at me. He said, “I’ll kill you,

Husband and wife Ilo Khabareli, 73, and Salimat Bagaeva, 69, from Zemo Achabeti,
described to Human Rights Watch the ill-treatment they each endured during detention by
South Ossetian forces. Ossetian forces entered the village on August 10. Bagaeva, who is an
ethnic Ossetian, had gone next door to her son’s house to check on it when 15 armed
Ossetian militia entered the house, pointed their guns at her and cursed her, saying, “Why
the fuck are you not leaving this place!?”482 When Khabareli, who is an ethnic Georgian,
came to the house to help her, they again yelled at Bagaeva saying, “Why did you marry this
Georgian pig?” One of the Ossetians then kicked Khabareli in the chest, knocking him down.
When he tried to stand, a second soldier hit him with the butt of a gun in the neck, knocking
him down again. When he was finally able to get up, one of the Ossetians punched him in
the face, causing Khabareli to lose several teeth. The Ossetian forces forced Khabareli and
his wife and daughter to stand facing the wall of their house while they shot at their feet and
in the air.483
The Ossetians gathered Bagaeva, Khabareli, and about 10 or 15 other Zemo Achabeti
residents and forced them to walk one kilometer toward Kvemo Achabeti. According to
Bagaeva, one of the soldiers told the group, “Come with us now, or you will all be killed. No
one is allowed to stay here overnight.”484 The group was put into a minivan and taken to the"

ground in front of my feet.”486 On that same day in Tamarasheni, three or four Ossetians

Tkviavi. As the van approached the center of Tkviavi, Ossetians on an armored personnel
carrier stopped it and forced the passengers out. Chalauri told Human Rights Watch, “I got
out and they hit me in the stomach with the butt of a gun. They were swearing at us … saying,
“You pigs, you killed so many of our people. Now we will kill you.”
The Ossetians forced the minivan’s male passengers, as well as the male passengers from a
car they had stopped in the same location, back into the minivan. An Ossetian drove the van,
but lost control of the wheel on the outskirts of Tirdznisi, and the van rolled over several
times. Chalauri told Human Rights Watch, “Most people got out of the van, but there was
one person left inside. The Ossetians then sprayed the van with gunfire. The man inside was
then dead, but I’m not sure whether it was from the accident or from the shooting.” Chalauri
was injured, and complained to us of pain in his head and back.490 Another man who had
been in the van, but managed to escape in the chaos immediately following the accident,
believed that the Ossetian driver was also killed.491
Another minivan arrived and the Ossetians forced the remaining 10 Georgians (at least four
had escaped) into it. Chalauri described the ill-treatment he and others suffered in the van
and the execution of one of the passengers:
We were made to lie on the floor face down [the van had no seats]. They
yelled at us, “Don’t lift your heads!” One big Ossetian man in heavy boots
was stomping on my ankle in order to try to force me to raise my head.

There was one young man, about 25, lying next to me. He raised his head
several times and was hit several times. Then all at once one of them loaded
his gun and shot the young man twice in the head to kill him and then shot a
third “control” shot just to make sure [he was dead]. The young man’s brains
came out of his head and onto my body. For 11 days I had to wear those same
clothes with his blood and brains on them. They … threw the body out
somewhere between Brotsleti and Megvrekisi.492
The Ossetians then took the remaining nine men to school No. 6 in Tskhinvali, which
Ossetian forces were using as an improvised base and where they had also held Georgian
prisoners of war. Ossetian captors again threatened to beat and kill the detainees. A doctor
treated two or three of the detainees who had been injured in the road accident, and gave
the group water. Later that evening they transferred seven of the men to the South Ossetian
Ministry of Interior. Two of the detainees were separated from the group and were not seen
again.493
Dmitri Abukidze, 24, from Tirdznisi, told Human Rights Watch that on August 13, Ossetians in
camouflage uniforms entered the village and began demanding that the residents provide
information about three Ossetians whom they claimed were detained by Georgian military,
saying, “Where are our three people, from Znauri? If you don’t find them, we’ll take you to
Tskhinvali.” They then detained Abukidze, his father, and several of their neighbors and
forced them onto an armored personnel carrier. According to Abukidze, “They started moving,
and some 30 minutes later I managed to jump off. They fired at me from an automatic gun,
and hit me in the leg. Then they let all of us go.” 494 The group was released apparently
because the Ossetian captors seemed reluctant to take a wounded detainee and several
witnesses to the shooting into detention.

conditions, Russian and Ossetian authorities had an obligation to provide humane

us, cursing us the whole time, and calling us, ‘You Georgian pigs, you motherfuckers.’”497
Others also described searches, which sometimes involved beatings or stripping of clothes,
as well as confiscation of money, cellphones, jewelry, and identity documents. Nothing was
returned to the detainees upon their release, except identity documents in some cases.498

However, former detainees told Human Rights Watch that many of the men, particularly the
young men, were beaten, and that some were beaten frequently. They described consistently
how men would be taken out of their cells and out of the basement, and how, when they
were returned, they showed clear signs of beatings.502 Manana Gogidze, 48, from
Tamarasheni, told Human Rights Watch that she witnessed young men regularly being
beaten:
We saw them being taken upstairs and we could hear their screams. When
they were brought back, they would bear clear signs of beating.… I saw the
bruises myself as I was trying to help them. There was a young man from
Tirdznisi who was beaten several times. I saw large dark bruises mostly on
his back … There was one [elderly] detainee … who spoke no Ossetian

windows, designed for short-term detentions. Women and men were held in separate cells.
The cells quickly became overcrowded and the guards eventually opened the doors of the

accessible from the basement.505 These areas quickly also became full as more detainees
were brought to the basement. According to one detainee, “There wasn’t even space to walk

clothing, and health care of the civilian population. People must be appropriately
compensated for their work, and there can be no obligation to work based on any form of
discrimination. Unpaid or abusive forced labor, or work that amounts to partaking in military
operations, is strictly prohibited.516
Vazha Lagazashivili, age 58, told Human Rights Watch that he was forced to work every day
of his 20-day detention:
They would take us out at 9 a.m. until late evening. We were cleaning the
streets. They told me that I must go. We had to clear dead bodies from the
street. We had to pick them up and put them into body bags. Some had
limbs missing. [We also] collected the body parts.
I was taken out sometimes to do other work, like unload trucks full of
humanitarian aid from Russia… They would give us one tin of food per person
and some bread after we unloaded the trucks. We could only rest when we
were given some food, for about half an hour. Of course I was not paid.517
Revaz R., 36, from Zemo Achabeti, confirmed that he was among 30 men who were forced to
work from early morning until 7 or 8 p.m. “We cleaned the street, threw out garbage, and
removed and buried the dead. We buried about 44 people. Most of the corpses were already
decaying,” he told Human Rights Watch. He also stated that while they worked they received
better food, such as canned meat.518 After about a week in detention, Ossetian forces also
forced 70-year-old Gaioz Babutsidze to work for two days lifting coffins off trucks and placing
them in graves. He estimates that they buried 50 bodies.519
Those who worked were also subjected to degrading treatment as they were taken from their
work locations to the Ministry of Interior building. “Sometimes they would make us walk
back to the police station … accompanied by four soldiers… People on the streets would yell

Detentions by Russian and Ossetian forces in other locations
Four Georgian men who had been working on construction sites in Java for several weeks
prior to the outbreak of hostilities on August 8 described their detention at two different
military bases prior to being transferred to the Ministry of Interior building in Tskhinvali.
Human Rights Watch interviewed separately two of the four, Gogita Kotuashvili, age 30, and
David Giunashvili, age 47, who described how the four fled Java on foot when Georgian
bombing of the town started on August 7. The men walked south hoping to reach a Georgian
village, but mistakenly entered an Ossetian village in the Znauri district in South Ossetia. A
group of armed Ossetian men in civilian clothes and several men in military uniforms,
apparently members of Russian and Ossetian forces, detained the four men. Upon detention
they beat the four, kicking them and hitting them in the back of the head with rifle butts.
They also confiscated the men’s identity documents, tied their hands behind their backs,
and blindfolded them before putting them into a car and driving them to what the men
described as a military base, consisting of a military tent as well as at least one tank.
The four men were questioned upon their arrival, including being asked whether they were in
the Georgian military. With their hands still tied, but their blindfolds off, the men were then
put into a hole dug out in the ground, approximately 1.5 meters deep, where they were held
for three days. They were given food packaged in military green boxes with Russian labels,
and saw cars with Russian license plates arrive at the base and heard Russian being spoken
in the tent. On August 9, two men wearing camouflage took the four detainees out of the
hole, again blindfolded them and tied their hands, and told them they were being taken to
Tskhinvali to be handed over to a Russian and Ossetian military base. When they arrived,
their blindfolds were removed, and the men could see a large amount of heavy military
equipment, including tanks, on the base. The two detainees interviewed by Human Rights
Watch said that many of the soldiers were Russian and Chechen members of the Russian
federal forces as well as other irregular fighters from Russia.
Upon arrival at this base, the captors, together with 10 to 15 military servicemen, forced the
four detainees to kneel down next to the bodies of two Georgian men lying on the ground.
They ordered David Giunashvili to shoot one of his fellow detainees, and Gogita Kotuashvili
to shoot the fourth detainee. However, when Giunashvili refused to shoot, the captors did"
faa6b803,189,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,4.3 South Ossetian Abuses in Undisputed Georgian Territory,Up in Flames 182,"not do anything in retribution, other than forcing the detainees to place the two dead bodies
in a car.526
The Ossetian and Russian forces then forced the men to sit near the edge of a swimming
pool, and beat them. Gogita Kotuashvili stated that he was beaten with rifle butts.527 The
detainees were placed in what appeared to them to be a guardhouse, with two beds. The
detainees were taken to eat meals in the canteen and were regularly cursed by the soldiers
on the base. After two to three days, on August 11 or 12, two men wearing blue and white
camouflage uniforms took the detainees to the South Ossetian Ministry of Interior in"

few days later at what is clearly the same Russian-Ossetian military base in Tskhinvali where
the four Georgians had been held. According to Eremov, men who appeared to be Russian
military detained him and Kebadze in Variani on August 16, drove them to the base, and
immediately placed them in the empty swimming pool. Eremov told Human Rights Watch
that at the base he saw Russians, Chechens, and Cossacks and a large amount of heavy
military equipment. Russian and Ossetian forces forced the detained men to remove all of
their clothes and stand facing the pool wall, with their hands tied behind their backs with
rope.
Eremov described how one Russian soldier questioned him while three Ossetians beat him:
“The [Russian] officer wasn’t beating me but the others were. The Ossetians would beat me
on the legs and on the shoulders with their gun butts, and the Russian officer would ask
questions.” Eremov heard other soldiers questioning and beating Kebadze, who shouted out,
“Just kill me! Don’t beat me anymore!” After three hours they allowed Eremov to dress and
released him by leading him to the woods and telling him, “Get the hell out of here and go
home!” Vazha Kebadze remained in the pool. At the time we interviewed Eremov, a week
later, Eremov had no information of what had become of Kebadze.529
On August 12, Sergo Mindiashvili fled Nikozi, right on the administrative border, because the
village was being bombed. He began walking to Gori, but was detained at an Ossetian
checkpoint in Shindisi. As six or seven Ossetians detained him, they kicked and punched

they forced him to get in a car. “They threatened to kill me if I didn’t do as they said. They
pointed a gun at me. [In the car] they continued to beat me all over,” Mindiashvili told"
98069831,190,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,4.3 South Ossetian Abuses in Undisputed Georgian Territory,Human Rights Watch.,"The Ossetian forces drove Mindiashvili to a location that he described as a base near
Tskhinvali, possibly the same base as described in the cases above. Mindiashvili described
his short detention there:
They started questioning me, but I was beaten good first. They didn’t explain
why I had been detained. They took me to … a sort of storage room. There
were about 10 to 15 Ossetians, all in camouflage uniforms. They kicked and
punched me and beat me with rifles... They asked whether I had served [in
the military], where the Georgian forces were located, … I knew one of them,
Alan, … he also beat me. … They decided I should be executed... They loaded
their guns and one person lifted his arms [to take aim]. I started crying.
Alan then intervened to stop the execution and the Ossetian forces placed Mindiashvili in a
small room. Mindiashvili told Human Rights Watch, “Anyone who wanted could come and
beat me. I spent two to three hours there. I was beaten several times.”
The Ossetians then took Mindiashvili to Variani and handed him over to Russian soldiers at
the checkpoint there. Two other Georgians were being held there; the Russian soldiers
treated one of the men’s wounds and gave all three men food and water. A Russian officer
questioned Mindiashvili and told the soldiers to “do away with him,” but once the officer left
the other soldiers released Mindiashvili.530

0cdef1bf,191,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,"4.5 Execution, Torture, and Other Degrading Treatment of Georgian",,"Prisoners of War by Ossetian Forces, at times with Russian Forces
Russian and Ossetian forces detained at least 13 Georgian military servicemen during active
fighting. All these detainees were entitled to prisoner of war (POW) status and should have
been treated as such. Human Rights Watch interviewed four, post-release, all of whom had
been captured in Tskhinvali by Ossetian militias on August 8. Human Rights Watch also
interviewed one of the Ossetian militia fighters responsible for holding the Georgian soldiers
for the first three days following their capture. All four Georgian military servicemen were
held in informal places of detention, including a dormitory and schools, for several days,
and were then transferred to Ossetian police. Ossetian police held several Georgian soldiers
for six days, including three of the four interviewed by Human Rights Watch. They transferred
one of the Georgian serviceman interviewed by Human Rights Watch to Russian custody,
where he was treated for wounds. Georgian soldiers reported that they had been subjected
to severe torture and ill-treatment throughout their detention by Ossetian forces. Human
Rights Watch documented the execution of three Georgian servicemen while in the custody
of Ossetian forces.
Ossetian forces eventually transferred 13 Georgian prisoners of war to Russian forces, and
Russian authorities exchanged them for five Russian prisoners of war on August 19.531
Russian forces had or ought to have had full knowledge that Ossetians detained Georgian
servicemen. They apparently participated in the execution of two Georgian soldiers, as well
as in interrogations of Georgian POWs in Ossetian custody. Furthermore, the Georgian
soldiers were held in Tskhinvali, over which Russia exercised effective control from August 9,
and therefore are to be regarded as having fallen into Russia’s power. Russia was therefore
obligated to afford them POW status and to treat them in conformity with the protections of
the Third Geneva Convention, which include absolute prohibitions on ill-treatment and
require POWs to be treated humanely and kept in good health.532 The execution, torture, and
ill-treatment of prisoners of war are grave breaches of the Third Geneva Convention and

repatriation of all PoWs “without delay after the cessation of active hostilities.” POWs are entitled to visits by the ICRC. While

Beatings and Humiliation during Initial Days of Detention
Three Georgian servicemen interviewed by Human Rights Watch—Davit Malachini, Imeda
Kutashvili, and Kakha Zirakishvili—were detained together by Ossetian forces on the
afternoon of August 8.535
The three were among a group of seven Georgian soldiers Ossetian forces took to the
basement of a four-story building, where Ossetian women and elderly as well as wounded
Ossetian militia fighters were hiding.536 Although some soldiers described the building as an
apartment block, an Ossetian militia fighter interviewed by Human Rights Watch and
involved in the detentions stated that the building was actually a dormitory of the
agricultural technical institute.537 The Georgian soldiers were given some food, water, and
cigarettes on the first day of detention.538 That evening additional men arrived at the building,
including some wearing helmets with plastic masks. According to Davit Malachini, a 26-year-
old sergeant, “They kicked us, cursed us, and beat us with the butts of their guns. They
spoke Russian and Ossetian.”539 Imeda Kutashvili, 21, who had been serving in the military
for only nine months, recalled, “They were beating us and swearing at us, saying, ‘You pigs,
why did you come here [to Tskhinvali]?’”540
The fourth Georgian soldier Human Rights Watch interviewed was Zaza Kavtiashvili. On
August 9 Kavtiashvili, 32, who had been shot in the knee during street fighting in Tskhinvali
that day and had been hiding on the ground floor of the dormitory, crawled down to the
basement to seek shelter for the night. He had no idea that Ossetian forces and others,
including the group of Georgian POWs, were there. Ossetian forces captured him and held
him with the others. Kavtiashvili recalled the moment of his detention:

nothing I could do. I could not walk. My leg was numb. They started beating
me as soon as they detained me. They beat me on the head with the butt of a
gun. They stood on my wounded leg and demanded to know where I had
dropped my flak jacket.541
The Ossetian captors held the POWs in the dormitory for two nights. On the morning of
August 10 they transferred all eight POWs to a school, possibly School No. 6, on the outskirts
of Tskhinvali. The Ossetians forced the POWs to walk approximately two kilometers through
Tskhinvali; the others had to carry Kavtiashvili because he could not walk. On the way,
Russian troops, Ossetian forces, and civilians beat and humiliated the group.542 According to
Kavtiashvili, “Anyone who wanted to beat us, beat us. I fainted several times because I had
already lost so much blood. I was in a lot of pain. Some people attacked us and grabbed dirt
and shoved it into the mouths of the guys carrying me, saying, ‘You wanted this land, well
here it is!’”543 Their route took them through Tskhinvali central square. Davit Malachini told
Human Rights Watch, “When we got to the square, whoever wanted to beat us, beat us …
They kicked and punched us, and those who were armed hit us with gun butts. We fell to the
ground. They threatened us, saying, ‘Let’s kill them. Let’s execute them.’”544 Kakha"

They beat us with gun butts, iron bars, whatever they had: wooden sticks,
chairs, even. Some of us lost consciousness. When we lost consciousness
[some of the attackers] would urinate on our faces to wake us up and began
beating us again.545
From the central square the men were then taken to the school, which was apparently
functioning as a makeshift base. According to Zaza Kavtiashvili, as many as a few hundred
Ossetian fighters were at the school, where they would eat and rest before going back

According to Davit Malachini, “First they beat us outside of the school. Ten or fifteen people
would come and beat us, then another group. Someone broke my rib. I couldn’t breathe
normally. They beat me on the eyes, back, legs, and head.”547"
d2d5711a,194,Part 4. Violations by South Ossetian Forces,"4.5 Execution, Torture, and Other Degrading Treatment of Georgian",Execution of Three Georgian POWs,"The Ossetian captors took the Georgian POWs into a small room that led off from a
gymnasium, where Russian federal forces were among those present.548 The Ossetians and
Russians inspected each of the Georgian soldiers’ hands, apparently in an attempt to
determine whether any of them bore the calluses characteristic of artillerists or tank gunners.
The captors singled out one of the men as a tank gunner and ordered him into a small
shower room next door. The other POWs identified the tank driver as Sopromadze but did
not know his first name.549
In describing what happened next, Davit Malachini told Human Rights Watch, “They called
the tank gunner out into a small room and then we heard shooting. Quite a lot of machine
gun fire.” Malachini, Zirakishvili, Kutashvili and one other Georgian POW were then also
called into the room. “The tank gunner was lying face down. They had shot him in the back
of the head. We saw that his head was open and his brain was exposed. It looked like a
watermelon cut in half.” 550
Although the Ossetian captors claimed that they had shot the tank gunner because he was
trying to escape, both Zirakishvili and Kutashvili described the scene in the room as one in
which some hasty preparation had apparently taken place. “Some kind of tarp or tent lay on
the floor and, from the position of the body lying on the tarp, it seemed that he had been
kneeling at the edge of the tarp when they shot him,” said Zirakishvili.551 An Ossetian militia
fighter, who was among the captors, confirmed that the tank gunner was singled out and
taken away deliberately. “One [of the prisoners], a tank gunner, was taken away by some of

prisoners again,” he told Human Rights Watch.552
The four POWs were then made to carry the body outside into a courtyard,553 while the
Ossetian captors threatened to kill them.554 Kutashvili stated that Russian federal troops
were also in this yard, and one Russian soldier with a gun, whom, based on his appearance,
Kutashvili believed was ethnic Russian, approached him saying, “I’m going to kill you now.”
However, another Russian federal soldier, whom Kutashvili described as “a large man with a
full beard,” and whom he believes was possibly Chechen, intervened to stop the shooting,
claiming that Kutashvili reminded him of his own son who also had been wounded in battle.
The first soldier pushed the bearded soldier aside and again made as if to shoot Kutashvili.
The bearded soldier punched the first soldier, and then protected Kutashvili from further
threats or beatings that night.555
The other POWs were beaten again after moving the body outside. Two POWs were made to
clean up the blood and remains in the shower room.556 The Georgian soldiers then carried
the body of the tank gunner to a location near a railway line where they were ordered to dig a
grave.557 According to Malachini, by the time they finished digging the grave, it was dark, and
so they wrapped the body in the tarp with a rope and left it unburied.558
The next day, August 11, the POWs witnessed one of their group, whom they identified only
as 21-year-old Khubulov, being singled out and led away, apparently because his surname
was Ossetian and he claimed to be ethnic Ossetian. Khubulov was beaten and dragged away
from the others, while the captors yelled at him, saying, “You will die! You are a traitor.”559
The Georgian POWs we interviewed never saw Khubulov again. When Zaza Kavtiashvili asked
some of his Ossetian captors about Khubulov’s fate, one of them replied, “We [killed him]
because he was an Ossetian traitor.”560

The Ossetian militia fighter who was among the captors and was interviewed by Human
Rights Watch apparently corroborated Khubulov’s execution. He told us, “And then a
Chechen fighter [possibly from the Russian Ministry of Defense’s Vostok battalion], who
came to us with some Russians and Chechens realized that one of our prisoners was an
ethnic Ossetian. He could not believe it at first, and then got very angry. He said that traitors
had to be punished, and took him out in the yard and just shot him.”561
Human Rights Watch documented a third extrajudicial killing of a Georgian soldier, which
also took place on August 11. A law enforcement officer of the South Ossetian forces
described to us how they had executed a Georgian armed man:
The day before yesterday [August 11, 2008], the Georgians killed two of my soldiers in the
village of Tamarasheni. We had been conducting a sweep operation there. We detained
three of them. Two of them didn’t do anything to us so we just let them go—we couldn’t take

something—a normal person would have surrendered, and this one was shooting at us
instead. We questioned him. He was the one who killed our guys. We executed him.562"

According to one of the Ossetian militia captors, “We did not know what to do with all these
prisoners and just passed them on to the [Ossetian] Ministry of Interior on August 11.”563 The
POWs described these Ossetian forces as all having identical “star-shaped badges on their
belts,” as being “physically big and strong,” and possibly being Ossetian special forces.564
Although Ossetian forces eventually transferred the injured Zaza Kavtiashvili to Russian
forces that day, they first interrogated him and beat and humiliated him. He described the
ordeal:
They separated us in the yard. [They] started interrogating us. They would
beat me, question me, then beat me, all the while also insulting and
humiliating me. They brought a Georgian flag into the yard and ordered me to

and threatened to kill me if I would not spit. One of the Ossetians also put
his foot on my wounded knee and pressed hard on it. Someone from the
second floor of the building ordered them to stop this and then they took us
inside the building to a room. There they beat me with chairs, metal sticks,
and the butts of guns. They broke my right arm. After all this they handed me
over to the Russian forces.
After being transferred to Russian military custody, Kavtiashvili underwent surgery on his leg
at a Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations hospital in Tskhinvali, and after several days
was taken to Java and from there flown to a military hospital in Vladikavkaz, North Ossetia,
for further treatment. Kavtiashvili was exchanged with other Georgian POWs on August 19.565
Several Georgian POWs, including three interviewed by Human Rights Watch, were held in
Ossetian police custody until August 17, when they were handed over to Russian troops.
Ossetian police held the Georgian POWs in degrading conditions and subjected them to
torture and severe ill-treatment. The soldiers were held in pairs in small cells and given very
little water and almost no food for six days. Ossetian police interrogated the soldiers a
number of times. One Georgian POW stated that Russian military forces visited them while in
detention several times and also sometimes interrogated them.566 Although both Imeda
Kutashvili and Kakha Zirakishvili had been wounded during the Russian aerial bombardment,
they received no medical care during their 12 days in Ossetian detention.567
Kakha Zirakishvili told Human Rights Watch about his experience in police detention, saying
that the previous days’ beatings “were nothing compared to what we faced at this place”:
They put us into cells and gave us only 100 grams of water for two people per
day. They beat us regularly. Five or seven guys would come into the cell, beat
us, get tired, go out, rest, come back, beat us. They would beat us until we
were unconscious. They punched us, kicked us, hit us with hammers and
with gun butts. They hit my hands with a hammer. They broke a bone in my
right hand, as well as in [my fingers]. They also beat me a lot in my face and
head with a hammer and even in the mouth. I lost one tooth on the bottom
as a result of the beating. Sometimes, two people would stand on my arm,

while another burned my hands with a lighter.… They gave us bread once …
but they gave us so little water for six days that I couldn’t eat anything.568
Davit Malachini and Imeda Kutashvili were held in the same cell and described similar
treatment. Malachini told Human Rights Watch,
Three Ossetians would come regularly, beat us for five, ten, fifteen minutes,
leave, come back again. They would beat us from morning until late at night.
This went on for six days. They tortured us. They put a bucket on my head
and would beat a stick against the bucket. Two guys would stand on my arm
and a third guy would burn my finger with a lighter. The skin was totally
burned through to the bone. They beat my ankles with iron rods and broke
one bone on my foot. They beat me on the head with butts of Makarov pistols.
We were only given a small amount of water and some bread and once some
buckwheat. But I could not eat because I was in so much pain. My jaw had
been beaten. They swore at us and cursed at us saying, “Did you want our
land? Did you want our money? If you wanted our land you can go and dig
your own grave here.”569
Imeda Kutashvili also stated that the Ossetians gave him very little water and almost no food,
and beat him regularly with hammers on his hand as well as by placing a bucket on his head
and hitting it. He also described beatings by Ossetian police using “anything they had on
hand.” “They beat us with chairs, belts, and ropes, and when the shovel broke, they used
the handle,” he said. “They beat me on the arms and on the soles of my feet with an iron rod.
While they were beating me I tried to cover my head, and they broke my hand. Sometimes I
lost consciousness and they would put water in my face to wake me up.”570 Davit Malachini
stated that while in Ossetian police detention he witnessed police urinating on another
soldier’s face to wake him up in order to begin beating him again.571
The physical and psychological consequences of this treatment are described below.

legs and arms were so swollen. I was trembling all over. I couldn’t control it.”574 Kakha
Zirakishvili said, “We couldn’t even really stand or walk. We leaned on each other in order to
move.”575
The Russian forces questioned the three men and then placed them in a basement together
with five or six other Georgian soldiers who had been detained separately. The Russian
forces did not physically ill-treat the three. They allowed the Georgian soldiers to wash,
shave, and rinse their uniforms and gave them food, water, and some basic medical

International Inquiry Commissioned by the European Union
In December 2008 the European Union commissioned a broad, six-month inquiry into the
conflict. Headed by a former head of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia
(UNOMIG), Heidi Tagliavini, the inquiry is to examine “the origins and the course of the
conflict ... with regard to international law, humanitarian law and human rights, and the
accusations made in that context.”581 An EU diplomat told Human Rights Watch that the
August war will only be a small part of the final report, which will look also at the events of
the early 1990s, and the historical context.582 The final report is due to be presented to the
EU, the UN, the OSCE, Russia, and Georgia on November 30, 2009.
The Council of Europe commissioner for human rights published three reports on visits—in
August, September, and November—to Georgia and Russia to assess the human rights
situation with respect to the conflict. The commissioner’s September 2008 report set out six
principles for the protection of human rights in the context of the conflict, which focused on
the right of all persons displaced by the conflict to return, the need for demining, and end to
the torching and looting of civilian property, the need for protection of prisoners of war and
other detained individuals, and the need for international agencies to be engaged in human
rights protection in the region.583 The two subsequent reports followed up on developments
under these six principles.584

South Ossetia residents in preparing complaints against Georgia to international and
regional courts. On August 12, 2008, the prosecutor general of the Russian Federation, Yury
Chaika, announced that he had created “a special brigade of prosecutors that would provide
legal assistance in preparing appeals and complaints to the European Court of Human
Rights and the Hague International Criminal Court.”585 While individual complaints can be
lodged with the European Court of Human Rights, it is a matter for the Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Court to determine whether there will be any cases opened against
individuals in any given situation. Individuals, governments, or organizations can submit
information to the Prosecutor about alleged crimes.
As a result, in the following two months, hundreds of complaints were submitted to the
European Court of Human Rights and cases for investigation sent to the ICC Prosecutor."

46d403ef,204,Part 5: International Scrutiny of Rights Violations in,,International Court of Justice,"The first case to be filed on the conflict was an interstate complaint the Georgian
government lodged against Russia at the International Court of Justice. In its complaint the
Georgian government sought from the court a declaration that Russia was in violation of its
obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
(ICERD) and asked for compensation.593 The complaint claims that Russia, acting through its
own agencies and “separatist Abkhaz and South Ossetian forces under its direction and
control has practiced, sponsored or supported racial discrimination through attacks against
and mass explusions of ethnic Georgians … in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.” It also accused
Russia of trying to change or consolidate changes in the ethnic composition of Abkhazia and
South Ossetia by preventing forcibly displaced people from returning to their homes in these
territories.
During the conflict the court made no conclusive ruling on jurisdiction or the merits of the
case. On October 15, 2008, it issued an order on provisional measures calling on Russia and
Georgia to observe their legal obligations under the ICERD to prevent “irreparable prejudice”
to the rights of persons before the court could rule on the merits of the case.
